--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) PLATFORM OVERVIEW & ARCHITECTURE
   • ServiceNow is an aPaaS platform used across IT, HR, Finance, Security, etc.
• Helps automate manual, repeatable workflows.
• Not just a ticketing tool — a full enterprise workflow platform.

ARCHITECTURE
• ServiceNow uses a **multi-instance architecture**:
  - Each customer gets its own application stack + DB.
  - No co-mingling of data with other customers.
  - Higher isolation, better control over updates & performance.

• Backups:
  - ServiceNow performs **weekly full backups** and **daily differential backups**.
  - Retention windows depend on customer subscription; exact # of stored backups
    is not fixed (no longer “4 weekly + 6 daily”).
  - Backups are used for restoration & cloning.

• High availability:
  - Redundant data centers.
  - Traffic failover during outages.


NOTE:->

MULTI-INSTANCE:
- Each customer gets their own separate, independent instance
- Completely isolated environment with separate database and servers
- Higher cost but greater customization flexibility
- One customer's data is completely isolated from others
- Example: Company A has Instance 1, Company B has Instance 2

MULTI-TENANT:
- Single instance serves multiple customers
- Data is logically separated using tenant IDs or row-level security
- Lower cost due to shared resources
- All customers share same application and infrastructure
- Easier to deploy updates (everyone gets them simultaneously)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) SECURITY & AUTHENTICATION
   SUPPORTED AUTH METHODS
• Local Database (username/password stored in User table)
• SAML 2.0 SSO (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
• LDAP integration
• OAuth 2.0 (commonly used for API & Mobile authentication)
• Digest Token (legacy; rarely used now)
• Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
  - TOTP (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
  - **FIDO2 / WebAuthn Passkeys (2024+)**
  - Email/SMS (depending on org policies)

ROLE-BASED ACCESS
• User → Group → Role hierarchy.
• Best practice: Assign roles to **groups**, not users.
• Base roles: admin, itil, approver_user, catalog_admin.
• Self-service users (no roles) can:
  - Submit requests/incidents
  - Access portal & catalog

• Impersonation: Admins can view system as another user.


NOTE:->

1) LOCAL DB (USERNAME/PASSWORD):
   - Username and password stored in ServiceNow database
   - Simplest method, no external systems needed
   - Risk: passwords exposed if instance compromised

2) SSO - SAML 2.0 (e.g., Okta):
   - User logs in via external identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
   - ServiceNow trusts the provider's verification
   - No password shared with ServiceNow
   - Best for: enterprise with multiple apps

3) LDAP:
   - Authenticates against company's Active Directory
   - ServiceNow queries LDAP to validate credentials
   - Syncs with on-premise directory
   - Best for: organizations with Active Directory

4) OAUTH 2.0 (CLIENT_ID + SECRET):
   - Third-party apps request access to ServiceNow
   - Client_id identifies the app; client_secret is app's password
   - Tokens granted instead of passwords
   - Best for: API integrations, third-party access

5) DIGEST TOKEN:
   - HTTP authentication for API calls
   - Password sent as hashed digest (not plain text)
   - Safer than basic auth; used for REST integrations

6) MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) (e.g., Google Authenticator):
   - Adds second security layer
   - User enters password + code from authenticator app
   - Can combine with any auth method (SSO + MFA, LDAP + MFA, etc.)
   - Best for: high-security environments

QUICK RULE:
- Internal users = Local DB or LDAP
- Enterprise = SSO (SAML)
- API access = OAuth or Digest Token
- Extra security = Add MFA on top

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) USER INTERFACES (2025 UPDATE)

ServiceNow now has **three major UX experiences**:

1. **Next Experience (Unified Navigation)** — NEW DEFAULT UI  
   - Introduced in San Diego release.  
   - Replaces legacy UI16 as primary UI.  
   - Provides workspaces, modern navigation, improved theming.

2. **Workspaces (Next Experience Workspaces)**
   - Agent Workspace
   - CSM Workspace
   - ITSM Workspace / Service Operations Workspace (2023–2025)

3. **Service Portal**
   - Modern self-service UI for end users.  
   - Still widely used.

⚠ Legacy UI update:
• UI15 is obsolete.  
• UI16 exists but is **not the recommended long-term UI**.  
• Many organizations migrate to **Next Experience**.

SUPPORTED BROWSERS
• Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari (latest versions recommended).

MOBILE APPS
-----------------------------------
• Now Mobile — for employees to submit requests, tasks, approvals.
• Mobile Agent — for fulfillers handling incidents/requests on the go.
• Mobile Onboarding — for HR onboarding processes.

2025 Update:
• All mobile apps now use the **ServiceNow Mobile Platform**, with enhanced
  offline support and deep-linking features.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--> UI EVOLUTION (important update)
   - Historically UI15 and UI16 were common toggleable UI versions. Since then,
     ServiceNow introduced the "Now/Next Experience" and workspace concepts (e.g.,
     Service Operations Workspace) and ongoing UI improvements across releases.
   - UI16 still exists in many instances, but **the recommended UI or experience may
     change with releases** — admins should follow release notes and the Now Experience
     guidance because elements (edge, layout, widgets) may evolve. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) ROLE-BASED ACCESS (components & best practices)
   - Components:
     * User   = individual (stored in User table)
     * Group  = collection of users (team, similar responsibility)
     * Role   = collection of permissions
   - Best practice: assign roles to GROUPS (not to individual users).
     * Easier maintenance: adding/removing users from group changes permissions.
   - Base (out-of-the-box) roles: admin, itil(provide read and write access to itsm applications like incident change), approver_user, catalog_admin, etc.
   - Self-service users: can log in with no roles; limited actions (raise incident, view catalog).
   - Impersonate: admins can impersonate other users to view their UI/permissions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) UI (Native) — Key elements & navigation
   - Main screen divided into:
     * Banner Frame (top): logo, user menu, global search, chat, help, settings.
     * Application Navigator (left): All / Favorites / History + filter navigator.
     * Content Frame (center): lists, forms, pages.
     * Edge (available in UI15 only).
   - UI versions: UI16 (default) and UI15 (user-switchable via Settings).

   - Banner Frame details:
     * User menu: profile, impersonate user, elevate roles, logout.
     * Global search: searches across tables; results depend on user's access.
     * Settings: theme, accessibility, list/form personalization, notifications.

   - Application Navigator:
     * All: apps/modules available to user.
     * Favorites: starred items.
     * History: recently visited (configurable timeframe).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) BRANDING (UI16 config / welcome page)
   - Change via: "UI16 Configuration" (System Properties -> Basic Configuration UI16).
   - Next Experience → Theme and Brand Center (newer configuration model).
   - Can update: instance name, banner image, color theme, date/time format.
   - Welcome page content configurable (short description, links, login messages).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) LISTS & FILTERS (concepts + operations)
   - List = records from a table (e.g., incident list).
   LIST ELEMENTS
• Title bar, columns, filters, breadcrumbs.
• List menu operations:
  - Create Favorite
  - View (different views)
  - Group By
  - Show (rows per page)
  - Refresh

• Context menu options:
  - Sort
  - Bar / Pie chart
  - Export (CSV, Excel, PDF, JSON, XML)
  - Import
  - Update Selected / Update All

FILTERS
• Built using conditions (field / operator / value).
• “Run” applies filter.
• Breadcrumbs show active filters.
• Save filters with visibility settings (Me / Group / Everyone).

VIEWS
• Different column layouts for different use cases (Default, Mobile, Major Incident).

SEARCH
• Inline search (per-column)
• Global list search (fields included depend on view)
• Search converts into filter conditions

TEMPLATES
• Predefined field values for quickly creating records.
• Scheduled templates can auto-create records on a schedule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) FORMS (concepts & config)
   - Form = single record display from a table.
   FORM ELEMENTS
• Form title, UI actions, form menu
• Sections (grouped fields)
• Related Lists (bottom)

SAVE VS SUBMIT
• Save → Save data, stay on form
• Submit → Save and close

FIELD TYPES
• Mandatory fields (red asterisk)
• Read-only fields
• Reference fields (link to another table)
• Choice fields (drop-down)
• Calculated/derived fields (e.g., Priority from Impact + Urgency)

ACTIVITY STREAM
• Work notes & comments tracked as timeline.

FORM CONFIGURATION
1. **Form Layout** — add fields, rearrange, create simple fields.
2. **Form Design** — drag-and-drop designer; create fields; set mandatory/read-only.
3. **Related Lists** — configure related lists shown at bottom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) INCIDENT MANAGEMENT (list/form examples)
    • OOB modules include:
  - Create New
  - Assigned to Me
  - All Open
  - All Incidents

• Priority = function(Impact, Urgency) (business rules)
• Templates used for common incident patterns.
• Copy Incident button creates a new record from an existing one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) FORM & LIST CONFIGURATION (admin/dev options)
    - Configure accessible via right-click title bar -> Configure -> {Form Layout, Form Design, Related List}.
    - List Configure -> List Layout, List Controls, List Calculation.
    - Form Design: drag field types to create custom fields; name fields; set mandatory/read-only.
    - List Layout: add/remove columns, create fields, set default view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) RELEASE MODEL (Important for admin exam)
-----------------------------------
• ServiceNow now releases **two major versions per year**.
• UI behavior may shift in each release.
• Admins MUST check release notes:
  - UI features (Next Experience updates)
  - Deprecated features (UI15, some legacy components)
  - Updated security/authentication options
  - Workspace improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) MISCELLANEOUS
    - Impersonation: used to verify end-user views.
    - Personal Developer Instance: demo instance provided by ServiceNow for practice.
    - Edge element: visible only in UI15.
    - Max rows per page on list: 100.
    - History keeps recent items (default ~10 days; configurable).
    - Favorites: create for quick access; can add icon/color.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14) KNOWLEDGE CHECK (selected Q&A from transcript)
    Q1: Apps visible to user with NO roles?    => Self-service
    Q2: Edge visible in UI15 or UI16?          => UI15
    Q3: Primary way to access platform data?   => Native UI (platform native UI)
    Q4: Should a role be added directly to user? => False (best practice: add to group)
