SERVICENOW TASK MANAGEMENT — EXAM NOTES (UPDATED FOR 2025)
================================================================================

1) WHAT IS A TASK?
------------------
• A task is any record that can be assigned or completed by a user.
• Examples: Incident, Problem, Change Request, Request Item (RITM), Catalog Task.
• Users create tasks and get notifications as the task progresses.
• Tasks can be assigned to:
   - A user
   - A group
• Tasks track work progress and ensure accountability across teams.
• Used across IT, HR, Facilities, Security, and other enterprise functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) TASK WORKFLOW EXAMPLE
------------------------
Scenario:
• User raises an incident because their computer stops working.
• Task is assigned to IT team → then routed to a specialist.
• Specialist troubleshoots and resolves the issue.
• Incident state changes to "Resolved".
• User receives email notification of resolution.

Purpose:
• Shows how a task moves through assignment, work, resolution, and closure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) TASK TABLE (CORE CONCEPT)
----------------------------
• **task** is one of ServiceNow’s core system tables.
• Almost all work-related tables extend from task table.
• Examples of tables that extend from task:
   - incident
   - problem
   - change_request
   - sc_request (Request)
   - sc_req_item (RITM)
   - sc_task (Catalog Task)
   - change_task
• When a table extends from *task*:
   - It inherits task fields (e.g., assigned_to, assignment_group, priority, due_date).
   - It can add its own custom fields.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) FIELDS INHERITED FROM TASK TABLE
-----------------------------------
Common inherited task fields:
• Number
• State
• Assignment Group
• Assigned To
• Opened By, Opened At
• Priority, Impact, Urgency
• Short Description, Description
• Activity Stream (work notes, comments)
• SLA fields (via related list)

Any extended table inherits these automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) TASK FUNCTIONALITIES
-----------------------
A task may include:
1. **Approvals**
   - Can be manual or automated (via workflows, Flow Designer, Approval Rules).
   - Approval types: Approve/Reject, Requested, Cancelled.

2. **Assignments**
   - Manual assignment.
   - Automatic assignment via rules or predictive models.
   - Assignment must respect access controls (user must have table access).

3. **SLA (Service Level Agreements)**
   - Tracks whether work is completed within agreed timelines.
   - Example: P1 incident must be resolved within 1 hour.
   - SLA is breached if resolution takes longer.
   - Related list: Task SLA → shows active & completed SLAs.

ServiceNow stores these in separate tables:
• task_sla
• sysapproval_approver
• assignment rules tables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) TASK ASSIGNMENT (2025 APPROACH)
----------------------------------
Ways a task can be assigned:

A) **Manual Assignment**
   - User selects Assignment Group + Assigned To.
   - Assigned To clears automatically if new group does not contain that user.
   - User must have necessary roles (e.g., itil) to access task tables.

B) **Assignment Rules**
   - Found under: System Policy → Assignment
   - Auto-assigns based on conditions (category, CI, urgency, etc.)
   - Components:
      • Applies To: table + condition
      • Assigned To / Assignment Group
      • Optional custom script section

C) **Assignment Lookup Rules**
   - Usually for Incident.
   - Simple matching: Category + Subcategory (+ CI) → assignment group/user.

D) **Predictive Intelligence (Machine Learning)**
   - Uses ML to predict:
       • Category
       • Priority
       • Assignment Group
       • Assigned To
   - Requires:
       • Plugin activation (not default)
       • Licensing
       • Model training on historical data

E) **Custom Scripting**
   - Business rules, Flow Designer actions, Script Includes.
   - Automates assignments with custom logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) SERVICE DESK APPLICATION
---------------------------
• A consolidated workspace for all types of tasks.
• Modules include:
   - Callers
   - Incidents
   - Knowledge
   - My Work
   - My Group’s Work
   - My Approvals
   - SLA (My Work SLA / My Groups SLA)

Purpose:
• Allows users and agents to see all tasks assigned to them or their group.
• Works for ANY table extended from task.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) EFFECTIVE TASK WORK MANAGEMENT
---------------------------------
1. **Work Notes**
   - Internal communication for agents.
   - Not visible to requester.
   - Used to log progress and troubleshooting steps.

2. **Additional Comments**
   - Visible to requester.
   - Used to communicate status updates or request info.

3. **Activity Stream**
   - Shows entire history:
       • Field changes
       • Work notes
       • Additional comments
       • Emails sent/received
       • SLA actions

4. **Email Functionality**
   - Agents can compose emails from the form.
   - Emails appear in Activity Stream.
   - Email sending requires user notifications enabled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) NOTIFICATIONS (OUTBOUND + INBOUND)
-------------------------------------
ServiceNow supports:

A) **Outbound Notifications**
   - Sent when:
       • Record is created/updated
       • Event fires
       • Flow triggers
   - Recipients:
       • Users
       • Groups
       • Fields on record (caller, assignment_group, assigned_to)
   - Stored in table:
       • sys_event_email_action

B) **Inbound Actions**
   - ServiceNow processes incoming emails.
   - Can:
       • Create records (e.g., new incident)
       • Update records (using watermark)
       • Run scripts
   - Conditions based on email headers/body.
   - Execution order determines which inbound action runs first.

C) **Watermark**
   - Unique ID embedded in outbound emails.
   - Helps ServiceNow match inbound email replies to correct record.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) NOTIFICATION CONFIGURATION (KEY FIELDS)
-------------------------------------------
WHEN TO SEND:
• Record Inserted
• Record Updated
• Event is fired
• Flow Designer trigger

WHO WILL RECEIVE:
• Users
• Groups
• Fields referencing users/groups
• Subscribable notifications (user-controlled)

WHAT IT WILL CONTAIN:
• Subject
• Message Body (HTML or Plain Text)
• Include Attachments
• Email Template (optional)
• Push Message Only (for mobile)
• From / Reply-To Address
• Importance (High/Low)

PREVIEW:
• Preview Notification button shows final email output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) INBOUND ACTION CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------

• Name
• Target Table
• Type (New / Reply / Forward)
• Action Type (Record Action / Reply)
• Execution Order
• Required Roles
• Conditions (email body, subject, headers, sender)
• Script (what action to perform)

Use cases:
• Creating incidents from emails.
• Updating tasks using reply emails.
• Auto-responding to users.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) SUMMARY OF KEY EXAM CONCEPTS
--------------------------------
• Task = core record for work; many tables extend from task.
• Assignment requires group membership + table access.
• SLA tracks time-based commitments.
• Predictive Intelligence = ML-driven auto-classification & assignment.
• Service Desk = central module for all tasks & SLAs.
• Work Notes vs Additional Comments = internal vs customer-facing.
• Notifications use conditions + recipients + templates.
• Watermark enables email reply matching.
• Inbound Actions automate task updates via email.
