Overview
This video explains the basic building blocks of ServiceNow:
– What a Record is
– What List View and Form View are
– Differences between List View and Form View
– How to navigate to Incident records
– How to create a new Incident record using the developer instance



What is a Record

– Simple definition:
A record = a row in a spreadsheet or table.

– Spreadsheet example:
Columns (fields) = First Name, Last Name, Company, Email
Rows (records) = actual data, for example:
Row 1: Pritam, Ganguly, ServiceNow, email-id
Row 2: Rahul, Bose, ServiceNow, email-id

– In ServiceNow:
– Data is stored in tables (e.g., User table, Incident table)
– Each row in the table is a record
– Each column is a field (First Name, Last Name, Company, Email, etc.)


– Data storage:
– All records are stored in the ServiceNow database in ServiceNow data centers
– When you search or filter, ServiceNow retrieves records from the database and shows them on screen
– You do not need to write SQL queries; ServiceNow provides powerful filters and UI to work with records


– Sys ID (sys_id):
– Every record has a unique key called sys_id (also known as GUID)
– 32-character unique identifier for each record in a table
– Used internally and in development (scripts, integrations, etc.)
– Automatically generated; you do not have to create or remember it
– Detailed use of sys_id is typically covered in developer-focused topics


What is List View

– List View = a view where multiple records are shown in a grid/table format.

Characteristics:
– Shows multiple records per page (rows)
– Columns represent fields like:
Number, Opened, Short Description, Caller, Priority, State, etc.
– Example: In the Incident list, you might see 67 incidents spread across pages
– You can move to next/previous pages to see more records

Fields in List View:
– Only a limited set of fields are shown to keep the list readable
– Not all fields of a record are visible in list view

Actions in List View:
– You can perform filtering and sorting
– Filter icon opens the filter panel
– Filtering is very powerful and is covered more deeply in the next video
– You cannot fully edit all record details directly like in the Form View

What is Form View

– Form View = detailed view of a single record.

Characteristics:
– One record per page
– Shows more fields and more details than list view
– When you click a record from the list view, it opens in form view

In Form View you can:
– See detailed information about that one record
– Edit fields (depending on permissions)
– Modify and update the record
– Work with more controls specific to that record

Comparison with List View:
– List View:
– Multiple records
– Limited fields
– Good for overview, searching, sorting, filtering

– Form View:
– Single record
– Many fields
– Good for detailed viewing and editing

Demo Summary – Record, List View and Form View

– Logged into the ServiceNow Developer instance
– Opened the Application Navigator (All)
– Searched for “Incident” in the navigator
– Clicked on “All” under Incident to open the Incident List

Incident List View:
– Shows multiple incident records
– Records provided by ServiceNow are demo/sample records for practice
– These are not real production records

From List View to Form View:
– Click any incident number in the list
– That incident opens in Form View
– In Form View you see many more fields and details about that incident


Shortcuts – Navigating to List and Form

Shortcut to open List View of a table:
– Type in the navigation filter or URL:
table_name.list

Example:
– incident.list
Opens the Incident table list view directly

Shortcut to open Form View (new record) of a table:
– Type:
table_name.do

Example:
– incident.do
Opens a new Incident form view (blank form to create a new record)

These shortcuts work similarly for other tables like change, problem, etc.



Creating a Record (Incident Example)

Steps (high level):

Open a new Incident form (for example using incident.do).

Fill in the key fields like:
– Short Description (e.g. “Demo testing”)
– Other required fields (depending on configuration)

Click Submit.

After Submit:
– You are redirected back to the Incident List View.
– The newly created record appears as a new row in the list.
– If you click that row/number, you see its details again in Form View.

This demonstrates:
– Form View is used to create and edit a single record.
– List View is used to see the record among many others.



Key Points to Remember

– Record = a single row of data with multiple fields (columns).
– Every record has a unique 32-character sys_id.
– List View shows multiple records with limited fields; allows sorting and filtering.
– Form View shows one record in detail with more fields and full edit capability.
– You can move from List View to Form View by clicking a record.
– Shortcuts:
– incident.list → Incident list view
– incident.do → New Incident form view
– ServiceNow Developer instance comes with demo data for practice.
