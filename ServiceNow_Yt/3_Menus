Topic: Menus in ServiceNow – List, Column, Field, Form, Related Lists

Overview
This video explains different context menus available in ServiceNow and how they help you work faster on lists and forms.
All demos are shown on the Incident table in a ServiceNow developer instance.

What We Learned in the Last Video
– Concept of Filter and Search in ServiceNow
– Different places where search is available (global search, list search, filter area, column search)
– Wildcard search conditions (contains, does not contain, equals, etc.)
– How to create filters using Condition Builder
– How breadcrumbs work and how to use them to quickly modify filters

What We Are Going to Learn in This Video
All topics are shown through demo:
– List control menu
– Column options menu
– List field menu
– Form controls menu
– Form field menu
– Related list menu

LIST CONTROL MENU

Where:
– On top of the list view (Incident list), usually as a menu icon called “List control” or similar.

Options in List Control Menu:

View
– Changes the view (layout) of the list.
– Default view: shows standard columns.
– Example views:
• Mobile view – fewer fields, optimized for mobile.
• Portal view – different arrangement of fields, e.g., Category, Number, Short Description.
– Use different views for different purposes but most of the time you will use the default view.

Filter
– Opens the filter/condition builder (same as discussed in previous video).
– Also shows saved filters.
– Example:
• “Daily report” filter created in last video can be selected here.
• Predefined filters like “Active” can be applied directly (e.g., Active = true).

Group By
– Groups list records based on a field.
– Example: Group by Category
• List is split into sections: Hardware, Network, Software, etc.
• Shows how many incidents are in each category, e.g., Hardware (11).
• Clicking the group header shows records under that group.
– You can group by any field in the Incident table (like Category, State, Assignment group, etc.).

Show (Rows per page)
– Controls how many records are shown on each page.
– Options like 10, 20, 50 rows per page.
– Example:
• Select 50 → first page shows 50 records, next page shows remaining records.

Refresh List
– Reloads the list data (like a refresh button).

Create Favorite
– Saves the current list (with its URL/view) as a favorite.
– You can give a name (e.g., “Incident report”), icon, and color.
– After saving, it appears under Favorites in the left navigation.
– Clicking the favorite opens the same list/view directly.

COLUMN OPTION MENU

Where:
– On each column header in the list (e.g., Number, Priority, State).
– Hover over the column name and click the small icon to open the column options.

Key Options in Column Option Menu:

Sorting
– Sort A to Z or Z to A (ascending/descending).
– Example: Sort Priority A to Z → Priority 1 comes first, then 2, 3, 4, 5.
– Sort Z to A → Priority 5 comes first.

Group By (from column)
– Same as Group By in List control, but applied from a specific field.
– Example:
• Click on State column → Group by State.
• To remove grouping, use “Ungroup”.

Bar Chart / Pie Chart
– Quickly generates a report based on the current list and selected column.
– Clicking Bar Chart opens a report view showing counts (e.g., count of incidents per State).
– Pie Chart works similarly but with a pie visualization.
– Internally uses the Report module; can be saved or customized later.

Launch Interactive Analysis
– Opens an interactive analysis view.
– Shows visual breakdown like:
• How many tickets are In Progress
• How many are High priority
• How many are Closed, etc.
– Allows adding filters and changing Group By (e.g., group by Assignment Group instead of State).

Configure
– Options like:
• List layout
• Business rules
• UI policies
• Data policies
• UI actions
– These are configuration/customization options and are covered in other videos (admin/developer level).

Import / Export
– Import records into the table.
– Export list data in formats like:
• Excel
• CSV
• XML
• JSON
• PDF

Update Options (when rows are selected)
– Update selected: update only selected records.
– Update all: update all records matching the current filter.
– Requires you to select rows first.

Show XML
– Shows how the record is stored as XML.
– Mainly for understanding or technical/debug purposes.

LIST FIELD MENU (List Row/Cell Options)

Where:
– On individual cells in the list (e.g., Priority, Category of a specific record).
– Right-click on a cell value to open this menu.

Important Options:

Show Matching
– Very useful shortcut.
– Example: Right-click on a record where Priority = 5 → Show matching
• The list is filtered to show only records with Priority = 5.
• A filter is automatically applied: Priority is 5.
– Example: Right-click on Category = Network → Show matching
• Shows only incidents where Category = Network.

Filter Out
– Opposite of Show matching.
– Example: Right-click on Priority = 5 → Filter out
• The list shows records where Priority is NOT 5.
• Filter applied: Priority is not 5 (shows 1, 2, 3, 4 only).

Copy URL to Clipboard
– Copies the record URL.
– You can paste it and share or store it.

Copy Sys ID
– Copies the unique sys_id of the record.
– Used mostly for integration, scripting, and admin tasks.

Assign Tag / Archive / Assign to Me
– Assign tag: add a tag/label for your own organization.
– Archive: archive the record (if allowed).
– Assign to me: quickly set the “Assigned to” field to the current user (e.g., System Administrator).

Follow on Live Feed / Show Live Feed / Add to Visual Task Board
– Additional collaboration and visualization options (covered deeper in other videos).

FORM CONTROL MENU

Where:
– On a record’s form view (top-left main menu on the form).

Key Options:

Save
– Saves the current record without exiting the form.

Visual Task Board
– Open record in visual task board context (covered in separate video).

Copy Incident
– Creates a new incident by copying the current incident.
– Short Description, Description, and other fields are duplicated.
– Useful when you want a similar incident created based on an existing one.

Create Related Records
– Options like:
• Create Problem
• Create Request
• Create Change (Normal, Standard, etc.)
– These are shortcuts to create related records linked to this incident.

Configure
– Similar to list configure:
• Form layout
• Business rules
• UI policies
• etc.
– Covered in customization/admin videos.

Export and View Options
– Export the record in different formats.
– View in other representations if configured.

Favorite / Copy URL / Copy Sys ID / Show XML / History
– Mark this record as favorite.
– Copy URL of the record.
– Copy sys_id.
– Show XML representation.
– View record history (changes).

Reload Form
– Reloads the form (refresh for the single record).

FORM FIELD MENU

Where:
– On individual fields inside the form view (e.g., Number, Impact, Priority).
– Right-click on a field label (not the value) to see field-level options.

Common Options:

Configure Dictionary
– Opens dictionary entry for the field.
– Shows:
• Table name
• Column name
• Data type (e.g., string, integer)
• Label (what is displayed on the form)
– Changing dictionary affects how fields behave across the application.
– Covered in detail in separate dictionary/config videos.

Configure Styles, etc.
– Other options like styles and field properties.
– Used to control look and behavior of fields.

Show Impact (or similar info)
– Shows technical details:
• Table name
• Field name
• Field type (e.g., integer, string)
– Helpful for admins/developers to understand underlying structure.

RELATED LIST MENU

Where:
– At the top right of each related list at the bottom of the form (e.g., related tasks, related incidents).
– Usually a small icon/menu on the related list header.

Options:

– Filter: apply filter on the related list records.
– Refresh: reload the related list data.
– Other options depending on configuration (similar idea to list control but for that specific related list).

KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

– List Control Menu:
• Change view, apply saved filters, group by, control rows per page, refresh, and create favorites.

– Column Option Menu:
• Sort, group by, create quick bar/pie chart, launch interactive analysis, configure list, import/export, show XML.

– List Field Menu:
• Show matching and Filter out are very powerful for quick filtering.
• Copy URL, copy sys_id, assign to me are common shortcuts.

– Form Control Menu:
• Save, copy incident, create related records (problem, request, change), configure, export, history, reload.

– Form Field Menu:
• Configure dictionary and show impact give deeper info about fields (table, column, type).

– Related List Menu:
• Filter and refresh for related lists under the main form.

All these menus are meant to speed up navigation, analysis, and configuration inside ServiceNow without needing to write code.
