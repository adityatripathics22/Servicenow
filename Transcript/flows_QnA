================================================================================

Q1. Why is a Decision Table an effective choice for changing product eligibility rules in a Flow?
Answer:
It allows quick updates to logic without modifying application code.
Explanation:
Decision Tables separate logic from code, making updates fast and safe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3. What is the function of inputs on an Action?
Answer:
They pass data into the Action.
Explanation:
Inputs supply required values so the Action can perform its task.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4. What should a Process Analyst do to avoid repeatedly assembling the same group of actions?
Answer:
Create a Subflow that can be called from other Subflows or Flows.
Explanation:
Subflows allow reusable logic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5. When would a developer use Do the Following Until instead of For Each?
Answer:
The actions must repeat until a specific condition becomes true.
Explanation:
“Do Until” loops run until a condition is met, not per item.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q6. How does a user update a published Decision Table?
Answer:
The user enables the draft authoring feature to edit the published Decision Table.
Explanation:
Updates require creating a draft and republishing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q7. How do Flows streamline automated processes?
Answer:
They centralize automation logic for enterprise-wide process orchestration.
Explanation:
Flows coordinate actions and logic, reducing complexity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q8. Which configuration allows a Subflow to receive data and return results?
Answer:
Inputs and Outputs.
Explanation:
Inputs bring data in; Outputs return data back to the Flow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q9. How do Flow Execution Details support debugging?
Answer:
They show success, failure, and skipped steps for each action in the Flow.
Explanation:
Execution details provide real-time troubleshooting visibility.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q11. How do Decision Tables simplify Flow automation?
Answer:
They replace lengthy if/else statements.
Explanation:
Decision Tables organize conditions in a structured rule format.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q12. How does a Decision Table add value to a Flow?
Answer:
It simplifies complex If Flow Logic.
Explanation:
Complex branching becomes easy to manage in a table.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q13. Which action makes a Decision Table available?
Answer:
Publish the Decision Table.
Explanation:
Publishing activates it for use in Flows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q14. Which configuration data is required when building a custom Action?
Answer:
Action Properties, Inputs, Action Steps, Outputs, and Error Handling.
Explanation:
These define behavior and data flow inside a custom Action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q15. What is the role of the Operations page in Flow monitoring?
Answer:
It displays execution details for completed and in-progress automations.
Explanation:
Operations lets users troubleshoot running or finished Flows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q16. What is a characteristic of a Subflow?
Answer:
It starts when triggered by another automation.
Explanation:
Subflows cannot run independently; they are always invoked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q18. What are the required elements for building a custom action?
Answer:
Inputs, Outputs, and Steps.
Explanation:
These define what data flows in/out and what logic runs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q19. How can you prevent Flows on the same table from overwriting each other?
Answer:
Create unique trigger conditions for each Flow.
Explanation:
Distinct triggers avoid conflicts and duplicate execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q20. What is one function of Flow Logic?
Answer:
It applies conditions to include or bypass specific Actions.
Explanation:
Flow Logic controls branching and conditional execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q21. How can Subflows streamline login-failure tracking?
Answer:
Use a specific Subflow to centralize login tracking logic across Flows.
Explanation:
Centralizing removes duplication and ensures consistency.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q22. Which feature helps developers decouple decision logic from code?
Answer:
Decision Builder.
Explanation:
Decision Tables externalize logic outside scripts or hard-coded flows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q23. Which feature visualizes how steps in a Flow are connected?
Answer:
Diagramming view.
Explanation:
It visually maps the flow path and structure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q24. What does a Trigger define in a Flow?
Answer:
It specifies when the Flow begins and the starting data available to it.
Explanation:
Triggers define start events and initial context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q25. How does a user create a reusable start condition for a Flow?
Answer:
Set up a trigger within Workflow Studio.
Explanation:
Triggers define reusable starting logic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q26. Which feature ensures a required input must be provided to a Subflow?
Answer:
Mandatory toggle.
Explanation:
Mandatory inputs must be filled before a Subflow executes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q27. A Subflow has Outputs but no values assigned. How to fix?
Answer:
Use Flow Logic to assign values to the Outputs.
Explanation:
Outputs must be explicitly set or nothing is returned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q28. How can a user simplify and maintain a Flow more efficiently?
Answer:
Store complex and reused processes in a Subflow.
Explanation:
Reusability reduces maintenance and duplication.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q29. Which feature outputs error information from a custom Action?
Answer:
Error Evaluation.
Explanation:
Error Evaluation sends structured error details to the calling Flow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q30. How does Workflow Studio’s homepage facilitate efficient navigation?
Answer:
It offers quick access to recent items.
Explanation:
Users can quickly resume work on recent Flows or Actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q31. How do Decision Tables simplify complex logic in Flows?
Answer:
They replace lengthy if/else conditions with structured decision rules.
Explanation:
Rule-based logic reduces complexity and improves maintainability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q32. What is the function of Skip Iteration Flow Logic?
Answer:
It bypasses the current loop iteration based on a condition.
Explanation:
It moves to the next record without executing remaining steps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q33. How does Workflow Studio organize different workflow object types?
Answer:
It displays each workflow object type in its own tab.
Explanation:
Tabs separate Flows, Actions, Subflows, and Decision Tables clearly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q34. What is the role of an Action?
Answer:
It facilitates the reusability of an operation across multiple Flows.
Explanation:
Actions encapsulate repeatable tasks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q35. What role does Flow Logic play in determining the execution path?
Answer:
It evaluates conditions to decide which actions to execute or skip.
Explanation:
Flow Logic controls branching and decision-making.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
