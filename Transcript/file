in service now platform overview and architecture
ServiceNow Platform Overview Architecture
2:49
servicenow platform servicenow is an american company
2:57
which has a product called servicenow platform
3:03
this company provides an application platform as a service which is called apas
3:11
it is a cloud-based computing model which provides the infrastructure needed to develop run and manage applications
3:23
servicenow platform is not limited to any business functions of any organization and can be utilized in
3:30
different areas of an organization like it hr finance security
3:38
organizations can utilize servicenow to automate manual repeatable processes and
3:44
standardize their service delivery
3:49
servicenow was known to be a ticketing tool however now it is an automation platform
3:55
in which you can automate different business processes
4:03
servicenow architecture servicenow platform is an application
4:09
platform as a service that means it is a single platform to automate business
4:15
processes across the enterprise by providing the infrastructure needed to develop run and manage applications
4:24
it is a single data model which is built on a flexible table schema and delivers
4:30
a common set of core capabilities and reusable components
4:37
servicenow platform has a multi-instance architecture rather than multi-tenant
4:43
architecture which is used by other cloud companies
4:48
in multi-tenant your data is co-mingled with other customers on
4:54
databases large and complex databases that require hardware and software
5:00
maintenance on a regular basis which can lead to availability issues for customers
5:07
if cloud companies have to take any action that affects this multi-tenant database and affects all other customers
5:15
whose data is residing on that database infrastructure
5:22
service now cloud is built on an advanced architecture called multi-instance
5:29
in this architecture your organization's data applications and customizations
5:34
reside in a unique software stack called an instance
5:39
your organization may have more than one instance each instance is isolated from every
5:47
other instance but they can still communicate with each other
5:54
servicenow provides high advanced availability data centers
6:00
in any situation there is an operational failure or outage your instance traffic can be quickly
6:07
rerouted to redundant servers to provide continuous availability
6:14
servicenow provides four weekly full backups of your data with six date of days of different daily
6:23
backups this is multi-tenant architecture in
6:30
which all three companies have shared app infra of the service provider
6:38
and this is multi-instance architecture which is provided by service now in
6:45
which every organization has their own instance whose maintenance will be
6:50
different from others
6:55
backup it is very important to know how servicenow makes sure that they are
7:01
taking the right backup of your instances as i mentioned earlier servicenow
7:08
provides four weekly full backup of your data and six days of daily differential
7:13
backups we need backup as it might happen that you can break something in your instance
7:20
and servicenow can restore everything back in your instance with the help of backup
7:26
this backup is also used in cloning activity as lower instances are copied
7:32
from production instances you can see on the screen we have main
7:38
instance and you have backup instance
7:44
security service now can also be integrated with
7:49
single sign-on services that are compliant with saml 2.0
7:54
standard you can further secure your applications and fields using role-based access which
8:02
we will learn later
Platform Interface
8:08
platform interface
8:14
ways of interacting with servicenow servicenow provides three ways to
8:21
interact with the platform user interface
8:26
which is also called as native ui
8:32
servicenow mobile apps which are mobile applications to access servicenow platform and its features from mobile
8:43
and last is service portal which is a kind of advanced ui for
8:48
servicenow platform all of these interfaces access the same
8:54
single system of record and common data model of the servicenow platform
9:01
example you have one instance one servicenow instance now all these interfaces can access the
9:09
same instance with the same data
9:17
native ui this is the native ui of servicenow
9:24
native ui is the main way to interact with the applications and information in
9:29
servicenow instance servicenow platform user interface
9:35
features include real-time form updates user presents
9:41
enhanced activity streams and an application navigator designed with tabs
9:46
for favorites and history this is my service now personal
9:51
developer instance i have got this instance from servicenow
9:56
free as they provide demo instances for admins and developers to practice
10:03
practically in service now and this is the native ui
10:09
supported browsers service now supports most of the major
10:14
browsers like chrome microsoft edge
10:21
firefox and apple safari if i can talk about my personal
10:27
experience then chrome and safari are the best
10:34
mobile apps service now offers three different
10:40
mobile applications service now agent
10:47
now mobile and servicenow onboarding
10:54
servicenow administrators can configure these applications as per the business requirement
11:01
these applications help employees and users working in service now to work
11:07
more efficiently and productively on the go
11:13
servicenow agent app is developed for agents working in servicenow as a fulfiller so that they can access the
11:20
request raised by different users and respond to them quickly
11:27
now mobile targets employees and users who request different services in
11:33
service now servicenow onboarding app is developed
11:39
for managing new hires it helps to facilitate the tasks required to be done before employees
11:46
start in the organization users can download these applications
11:52
from the app store of ios and android
12:00
service portal service portal provides a user-friendly
12:06
self-service experience it is an advanced ui of servicenow
12:12
platform which provides access to specific features by using different
12:17
widgets which can be customized and developed by servicenow developers
12:24
users can search knowledge articles request for any service and much more on
12:30
service portal you can open servicenow portal by adding
12:35
sp in the url so after domain name of
12:41
service now if you add sp sp press enter
12:48
you will be able to see service portal which is an advanced ui
12:54
now here users can search anything like outlook
13:03
so they can search for information they are looking for they can also access the catalog that
13:09
means they can request something directly from service portal
13:15
they can see their own request so if they have raised some incidents or request in servicenow platform they can
13:22
see them you can also go to home from here
13:27
so here you can click and request for any service you can search for knowledge base you can
13:33
get some help and you can just go for the community these are the different links which
13:38
which users can access now these features now these options are
13:44
available as per the access given to the user and you can see we have a lot of other
13:51
options on the top so this is service portal interface
13:58
supported authentication service now can support different types
14:04
of user authentication first is local database
14:10
in which user and password is saved in servicenow instance in the related user
14:16
record and user needs to put username and the password on welcome screen which i just
14:22
showed you earlier the next supported authentication is
14:28
single sign-on in which the user is authenticated with details provided by identity provider
14:38
for example you have octa which is an identity provider which you
14:44
can configure in service now and user has to log in via single
14:49
sign-on then we have ldap
14:54
in which user is authenticated via lightweight active directory account
15:02
oauth 2.0 which is also supported and it's an open
15:08
authentication and it is authenticated by a client id
15:13
and secret a client id and secret is provided by
15:18
servicenow to the consumer whenever consumer will hit servicenow in
15:24
order to authenticate he will send client id and secret
15:31
and service now will identify the user and will authenticate with the help of
15:37
oauth client id and secret
15:42
digest token encrypted username and password in the form of a token is also supported
15:51
and that is digest token lastly we have multi-factor in which
15:58
authentication is done via an otp code provided by google
16:06
authenticator role-based access once you are logged in into service now
16:14
the next level of access is based on the roles provided to the users
16:20
these roles are assigned to the users on the basis of their functions responsibility
16:26
as an example item admin
16:32
knowledge admin approver the information which can be
16:37
accessed by the user is based on these roles this ensures that people have access to
16:45
the information which they are allowed to access it is very important to protect
16:51
sensitive data components
RoleBased Access
16:58
in order to understand how role-based access works in the platform it is
17:04
important to first understand its components
17:10
user a user is an individual that has been granted access to your servicenow
17:16
instance group a group is a set of users who are
17:23
part of the same team or may share same responsibility members of groups perform similar tasks
17:30
or need access to similar information for various purposes in the platform
17:35
such as approving change request resolving incidents receiving email
17:41
notifications or administering the service catalog
17:47
users working in servicenow are typically assigned to one or more groups
17:55
role a role is a collection of permissions which can be assigned to a group so that
18:02
whole group members can have the same access related to that role in
18:07
servicenow platform example itel
18:13
admin etc service now has an out of the box user
18:18
table which stores data of users in application navigator go to users
18:26
module under system security may be under
18:32
system administration you will find users if you will click here
18:39
you will see all the users of your servicenow instance
18:45
let's open one of the user record maybe this one you can see the details of the user
18:53
and the local database which we were talking about that is this one so here i have the user id
19:01
and here i have password once i will set the password and user id
19:07
for a particular user user can log in with the help of that username and the password
19:14
if he can see that welcome screen
19:20
service now also has an out of the box group table which stores the data of different
19:26
groups of teams in the organization in the application navigator you need to
19:32
type groups
19:38
and at the bottom you will see under system security or maybe under user administration you will see crypts
19:48
once you will click on groups you will see the list of groups available in your instance
19:54
now as of now these are out-of-the-box groups when i say out of the box oob that means
20:01
that particular feature element is already provided by service now nobody
20:06
has created it manually servicenow has given the ready instance to you whatever
20:13
comes with servicenow platform that is out of the box
20:18
so here you have list of groups let's open one of the group record
20:26
this is the name of the group is application development
20:31
here is the manager and here are the details of this particular group
20:36
now at the bottom you can see we have some some details more details about this group
20:42
that means here you have roles so if you want to provide some access to
20:47
this particular group you can add roles here we have group membership
20:53
that means in this particular group you have these six members
20:58
now this is what group is here we have groups if if you have any
21:05
child groups under this particular group you can also assign skills and any locations so these are the details
21:12
related to a group then we have roles
21:18
which is also an out-of-the-box table of service now which stores different roles which can
21:24
be assigned to different users and is created for different types of access in
21:30
the system for roles you can again go to system security
21:36
under system security you will see roles module click on that module
21:41
you will see the list of roles available in your system now as of now i have not done any
21:48
customization so these 336 roles are out of the box roles
21:54
let's open one of the role maybe admin 1. when you will click on that particular
22:00
role you will be able to see details of the role
22:05
here the name of the role and it says about the description that this is system administrator role
22:12
this role has access to all system features functions data regardless of security constrained
22:20
here you can see where what what roles this particular role contains you can see here what applications we have
22:27
assigned this role to then what modules custom tables subscribed users these are
22:34
some other information which you can see just to see the details of the roles
22:40
but what additional elements what additional functionalities have been assigned to this particular role
Roles Assigned to Groups
22:48
roles assigned to a group once you are done with defining a role
22:54
with relevant permissions it can be assigned to a group or user
23:00
as a best practice you should always add roles to groups rather than individual
23:06
users which will be easy from a maintenance perspective
23:14
as an example you have x group where we have added two roles
23:21
role x and role y rolex might have
23:27
different permissions like permission 1 permission 2 permission 3
23:33
and role y can have different permissions too like permission one again permission two
23:40
in that case x group the members of x group will have
23:46
all these five permissions and the reason behind it
23:51
because you have added these two roles in the group so even if you add 100 group members
24:00
into this x group the all those hundred members will have all these five permissions
24:08
so in that case it is pretty much easy to maintain the groups and roles
24:15
and if you don't want to give access to any particular person or maybe five people let's say an example in that case
24:23
you just need to remove those five people from x group in that
24:30
case all these five permissions will be removed as well
24:35
otherwise if you will add individual roles to individual users
24:41
then you have to remove the role separately from all five users individually
24:48
and that's pretty much i would say not for not good from maintenance perspective
Base System Roles
24:56
base system roles servicenow comes with baseline roles
25:02
for out-of-the-box applications and features
25:07
as an example admin role which will provide you the access for the whole platform
25:14
and this role is basically added to all the administrators and developers of servicenow instance
25:24
then we have approver underscore user that is also one of the type of role
25:30
which provides access to approve the tasks
25:35
itel role which provides read and write access to itsm applications like incident change
25:43
and problem catalog underscore admin
25:49
which provides access to manage service catalog and many more roles
25:56
users can still login into service now even if they don't have any role assigned to them
26:02
and access some of the applications and elements like home page
26:08
raising of incident and request accessing the service catalog
26:14
these users are also called as self-service users
26:20
servicenow has one of the major features that is impersonate
26:25
that means you can get the view of any user if you have proper rights
26:32
as i have admin access i'm going to impersonate a user who does
26:37
not have any role so let me search for that user first
26:44
or maybe let me create it so we will go to user table
26:51
so i'm going to users module and here i have a new button
26:57
so let me create a new user i'm clicking on new and here i will give
27:04
the id is just demo user first name i can give demo last name i
27:11
can give user i don't have to fill other details
27:16
uh password if i want for now so i will give demo
27:22
maybe i'll just i won't say that password but i will just give a random password
27:28
for now and i'm going to save this now i'm not going to give any role to
27:35
this particular user and this user has not been added to any group as well as you can see at the
27:42
bottom we have groups and roles so no roles no groups as of now what i'm going to do
27:49
i'm going to impersonate this user but before that let me show you because i have logged in as an admin i can see
27:56
all these applications almost all the applications where i have access to as
28:01
an administrator now i will impersonate to impersonate you need to click on your profile
28:08
and here you will find these options now one of the option is impersonate user
28:14
click on impersonate here it will ask you to search for the users now i can search maybe i will type demo
28:23
here is the user it is showing its first name last name and also the user id
28:28
so i will click here and now this will show me the view that how that user will
28:34
really see it so you can see now in the left hand side
28:40
do you think i have same application so answer is no so you can see i have
28:45
different dashboard here i cannot change the dashboard here because i don't have
28:51
any any uh role into my account i have just these few applications which are
28:57
basically allowed me allowed to see so i can i can quickly see these
29:03
applications however i cannot access anything else
29:10
so this is what a self-service user is now let me show you
29:15
an idle user who has pretty much more access than self-service user
29:23
so i will click here rather than end impersonation i will click on impersonate user
29:29
and i will search for itel there should be a idle user so i do have an idle user
29:34
here i will click on that now this time it will impersonate idle user which i have in my
29:41
service now instance and you can see the access is pretty much different
29:47
what we had in self-service user where we didn't have a single role into that
29:53
particular account but here because it's an idle user so he has idle role
30:00
in his account so in that case i have access to more modules you can see pretty much
30:07
more modules we i have access to these applications as well like incident change problem configuration and many
30:15
more i have access to this different home pages as well and here you can see i can
30:21
select as well where self service user does not have that option
30:29
that he can select any home page but we have this functionality available for
30:37
idle user so this is how access level varies in
30:43
different users account if it is a self-service user if it is a
30:49
idle user the access level the visibility of the modules and applications and home page will be
30:56
different from others users user interface
31:02
in this section we will learn about elements of servicenow ui
31:07
how role-based access works application navigator favorites and
31:14
navigation user interface
31:20
when you access servicenow url then you get service now login screen
31:26
where you need to enter username and the password once you log in you will see the native
31:33
interface of servicenow this native interface shows different
31:39
elements and functionalities here is my instance url
31:45
and this is welcome screen let's login to my personal developer
31:51
instance i will put username and password
31:59
click on login now as of now i have logged in as an admin
32:05
and i'm able to see all the applications of the platform which are allowed for
32:10
admins so you can see in the left hand side i'm able to see
32:15
almost all the applications wherever allowed for admins
UI Versions
32:21
service now ui version service now has two ui versions
32:27
ui 16 and ui 15. users can switch between these two
32:34
versions as per their personal choice
32:39
let me show you in my personal developer instance in order to switch between these two
32:46
versions you can click on the settings on the right top and then you will see a pop-up
32:53
on the right top of this pop-up you will see switch to ui 15 button when you will click this button you will
33:00
be able to change the ui version and this version will be changed to ui 15.
33:08
this is ui 15. now you can also change back to ui 16
33:13
with the same options so you have to click on settings you will see this option switch to ui 16
33:20
once you will click that you will go back to ui 16. now it depends on the user what kind of
33:27
ui you will you want to work upon so if you like ui 16 you can work on us16 if
33:34
user wants to work on ui 15 they can work on ui 15 as well
33:39
ui elements service now's main screen is divided into four ui elements
33:48
banner frame which appears at the top of every page and contains the logo user
33:53
menu system settings and global search application navigator which provides
34:01
easy access to applications and modules of servicenow instance
34:06
third is content frame which shows the information of application or module selected
34:13
you will see form list and other pages in content frame
34:19
so this is how the screen is divided into different elements there is one more element and that is
34:26
the fourth element of servicenow ui that is called edge
34:32
however it is not visible in ui 16 and it is available in ui 15. so in ui 15
34:40
you still have all other three elements however there is an additional element
34:46
that is called edge
34:53
let's see the components of banner frame on the left top you have company logo
35:01
and name of the instance as an example you can see here we have
35:06
servicenow logo and the name of the instance is service management
35:13
on the right top we have user menu once you will click on user menu you
35:19
will see more options like profile which shows the details about the user then
35:25
you have impersonate user which enable other user view then we have elevate
35:30
roles which will elevate the role for logged in user and the last option is
35:35
log out now beside user menu you also have global search icon
35:42
where if you want to do any kind of search on the platform you can do with the help of this global search icon
35:50
then we have chat help and settings
36:00
application navigator application navigator is at the left hand side of the screen
36:08
you can navigate to different applications and modules in service now
Application Navigator Elements
36:16
application navigator elements application navigator has also three
36:23
different elements first is all applications tab where you
36:29
can navigate all applications available to the user as per the access
36:36
then we have favorites tab which shows all the applications and modules marked as favorite via star
36:44
button beside the applications and modules and last we have
36:51
history tab which shows the items which we have recently visited
36:57
that means the logged in user whatever items whatever elements he has visited
37:02
recently those things will be visible in history tab this is my personal developer instance
37:11
on the top you have banner frame here we have application navigator
37:17
and here we have content frame the edge is not available in ui 16 as i
37:24
mentioned so in order to see the edge you have to go to ui 15 version
37:30
so i will click on switch to ui 15 and i will show you what is edge element
37:38
so you can see here so we in this particular version we do have banner frame we do have
37:44
application navigator we do have content frame however there is an additional
37:50
element and that is called edge here so this is the difference between ui 15
37:58
and ui 16. let's go back to ui 16.
38:13
on the banner frame you have logo then you have name of the instance
38:19
here it's for developers which you want to enable the option i can also disable these options so i
38:26
need to go to developer option here and i can just disable them as you can see whenever i'm disabling
38:33
them it is getting disappeared from here so i can just enable this as of now i
38:39
will close this here i have user menu so if you will click this button you will see your
38:45
profile impersonate user option elevate roles and log out if i will click on
38:51
profile i should be able to profile the user profile for the logged in user so
38:56
you can see as of now my profile is system administrator and that is what
39:01
you can see here now the view is self-service view there are more details which we will talk about later but as of
39:08
now if you are just an end user so this these are the details which you can see
39:14
as part of your profile in service now then you have some other options like
39:19
impersonate user then we have elevate roles if you will click this button you can elevate the role you have
39:26
normally security admin is the role which is basically added as part of the elevation of the role
39:32
then you can cancel this one if you will select this and click on ok then your session will have that security admin
39:40
role as well but i will not do anything for now you will learn it later
39:46
and then we have global search once you will click this search button it will expand and then you can type something
39:52
if you want to search so as of now i'm just typing knowledge i will press enter when you
39:58
will press enter it will try to search in the whole platform the keyword which
40:03
you are typing in the global search you can see here it is trying to search
40:09
all the tables you have in your system and then it will show you the results
40:15
now the results which you are getting right now because i i am logged in as an admin so i can see a lot of information
40:22
however if you are just log in as an end user maybe maybe an itel user in that
40:28
case you will be able to see the search results as per the access you have the tables
40:33
access you have in servicenow system then we have chat option
40:39
here you can chat with different users of the organization so if they are in service
40:45
now they can they can do chat as well then you have one help icon and then we
40:51
have settings where you have different settings and settings are like general settings you can change the theme of
40:57
this instance as well so these are some themes which are provided by servicenow
41:02
out of the box and then we have some accessibility options
41:07
then if there are some configurations for list you can do some configurations for forms
41:13
uh notifications as well you can you can manage your notifications from here as
41:18
well and then it is for developers so if you if you have admin access basically
41:23
this is for developers you can see here if you can change some settings which we will learn later as part of our
41:30
development section in the left hand side you have application navigator now what are its
41:38
features so here you have filter navigator that means if you will type here for any application
41:45
it will automatically be displayed so it will try to search for that and it will show you all the relevant results here
41:52
so as of now you can see i typed incident so at the top i also have incidents because service desk
41:58
application has one module that's called incidence that's the reason you're able to see that in this particular view and
42:05
then you have incident itself an application and then some of other modules but that's how you can see
42:12
different applications and that's the reason we call it as application navigator now the second tab in
42:18
application navigator we have it's about favorites how exactly you can tag these favorites you go here now whatever
42:25
applications you have here so as of now you can see i just have this one one application or one module i can just
42:31
remove it for now this is how you remove it basically now if i want to maybe make this particular
42:38
application as a favorite i can do one thing i could directly uh tag this whole
42:43
application or maybe i want to make just one module as a favorite i can also do that so at the top you this is
42:50
application under that you have these modules so i can just click this once
42:55
you will click that you can see it has it has already already selected both the modules under this application so if you
43:01
will go to your favorites tab now and you will see this guided setup is already there but this is how you can
43:09
you can uh tag or or or just mention some favorite applications which you normally work upon maybe maybe daily so
43:16
in that case you can you can just tag them as favorite and they will be displayed here
43:21
the last tab we have is history now this is automatic so whatever applications
43:27
whatever data whatever records you are viewing in service now that history has
43:32
been basically is being recorded and you can see those contents here so for example if
43:39
you can see it says nine days ago 10 days ago so i think it it tracks
43:44
i think from last 10 days you can change that as well so as of now you saw maybe
43:49
you saw this user so if you remember we were seeing this profile
43:55
so that's the reason it it already got captured as part of the history but
44:01
that's the reason history is pretty much important so if you are working daily or for a day you want to just remember what
44:07
all options you have selected you can just quickly go with that and you don't have to search from here because you might get
44:14
those details in the history section because you might have searched or used or clicked on that kind of module or
44:21
applications users navigate to applications and modules to use them to see the content
44:28
what exactly they have to utilize the functionalities so in that case if i will go here
44:34
let's say i have this incident application now under incident application i have
44:39
different modules so if i click this button which is called create new module so i'm
44:46
i'm able to create a new incident record so that's how this application and
44:51
modules are used as part of this application navigator so whenever you are creating something in service now
44:58
you have to provide those functionalities those those elements via application navigator so that people
45:05
users can search for those applications and modules and utilize them
Branding
45:11
branding overview branding is something you need to configure your instance to identify as
45:18
per your company let me show you in my personal developer
45:24
instance this is my personal developer instance
45:31
if you're working for an organization then how would you know that servicenow instance is associated with your company
45:40
you should have logo and instance name so that you can recognize your company's
45:45
instance maybe the color theme as well
45:51
so branding can be done in service now in various ways
45:56
let me show you how exactly you can do this configuration for changing the branding for your servicenow instance
46:05
in order to do this branding you need to go to ui 16 configuration
46:13
for that just type ui 16 in filter application navigator
46:18
and you will see this module under system properties that is basic configuration ui 16.
46:25
once you will click that module you will see the configuration the branding for
46:30
ui 16 version of your instance you can see here we have this image
46:37
banner image which is which is showing here and then you have the name that is service management now as of now it's
46:44
you can see it says sas now but let me just change it quickly it says sas now
46:52
system maybe and i will go little bit bottom here i
46:58
have this save button now you also have some other uh configurations for color
47:04
background how exactly the date would be the date format uh time format that is
47:10
something you can do here and then i am going to
47:15
click on save once you will click on save you will see you have this sas now
47:20
system i can change this again if i type and ideally you can see even if i'm not
47:26
saving it it is automatically picking it up so i'm just doing sas now demo system
47:32
and i am just clicking save now and now you can see i have sas now demo
47:38
system now i can also change this banner image i just need to click this plus button
47:45
once i will click this plus button it will take you to your system directory
47:50
that means your computer directory and then you can add any image you want
47:57
i'm not adding adding any image for now because i just want to show you that how exactly you can change this
48:04
configuration so this is how you do branding
48:10
now you can also change some more settings some more configurations like welcome page configuration so i
48:17
will show you that before that let me change those so you can do that with the help of
48:22
welcome welcome page content
48:28
so you will click this button this is the module it says system ui so under system ui how you have this welcome page
48:35
content and you will find some some kind of configurations over here
48:40
so for example if i click on more information
48:46
here you have short description more information and then you have some some
48:52
links here can be found here you can change this text as well so if i go back
49:00
then i have login so here it says you are not currently logged in so view is restricted
49:07
public so if you wanna as of now it is not active now which one is active so
49:12
only these three are active so if i click here about
49:19
here you can see it's it's about the instance as of now it says servicenow is changing
49:25
the way people work it's it's the whole statement is there now i can change this
49:31
how i will just maybe let's say i'm making it sas now
49:37
now because it is your instance if you want to change it for your end users you can do that so i'm putting sass now for
49:44
now and i'm just clicking on save so this is save and i will show you
49:50
where exactly it will replicate so for that i need to log out from
49:56
service now once i will log out you will see that
50:01
keyword which i changed you can see we have the sas now here
50:06
initially it was serviced now but i can change this as well so this is about welcome page settings so if you want to
50:14
change the configuration some settings for welcome page you can also do that
50:19
with the help of those modules i just showed you so the overall branding you can change as per your business
50:26
requirement as per your company's requirement
List Filters
50:31
list and filters in this section we will learn about
50:36
lists component of list list personalization
50:41
filters and list search
50:47
list a list displays the racket from a data table
50:53
such as the incident problem or user table
51:00
list elements they are different elements of list
51:07
starting with main list which shows the list of records in a
51:12
table like incident table records in a list
51:19
title bar which is at the top of the list
51:25
filters which is used to put condition and filter the data displayed in the
51:31
list of table records
51:36
breadcrumbs which is created when you add different filter conditions
51:42
and shows what conditions are selected and that's called breadcrumbs
51:51
column and field which is the field of the table where data is stored for a table racket
52:00
as you can see we have number field selected it's a column and it's a field as well where the number of the record
52:09
is being stored list title menu
52:16
which shows some options to manage the list like view filters which allows you to select the
52:23
filter created grouping of data as per the field so you have group by
52:28
then you have show in which you can select number of records that how how many number of records you want to
52:34
display to the user on the same screen and then you have a refresh list
52:42
so for example if you are changing something in your list and you want to refresh the list maybe you want to
52:48
display the data in that case you can refresh the list as well
52:54
and then last option you have is create favorite once you will apply the filter
53:00
once once you will apply the condition for the filtering the data then you can also create the favorite for that
53:06
particular data which is being displayed
53:12
list context menu now this shows more options which can be used for different
53:18
functionalities so when you left click on the title bar
53:24
then you will get this option where you can see different functionalities
53:30
like you can sort the data you can show visual task board it will take you to the different functionalities you can
53:37
convert this list into a bar chart as well into a pie chart as well you can
53:43
export the data into excel into some other other extensions you can also import
53:49
some data into the same list you have you can update all the data which are
53:54
being displayed on the screen you can import xml data and you can also
54:00
see the xml data if you want to see that so whatever data is being displayed in
54:07
your list you can perform all these functionalities as per your requirement
Incident Management
54:13
let me show you the list and filters for incident management application
54:20
that means i will show you the list and filters for incident records
54:26
for that we need to go to incident application and i will type incident
54:34
and here you have this application incident now how exactly you can see the list in
54:41
order to see the list you might have some modules which will automatically show
54:47
you the list for incident records so if you will click this button this
54:53
particular module open so starting with this is create new this will create a
54:59
new incident so this will not show you the list this will show you the form so then you have assigned to me now this
55:05
is out of the box servicenow has already provided you these modules if you want
55:11
to add your modules you can do that as per your filter conditions now what is
55:16
the difference so if you will see here assigned to me now as of now the thing this particular
55:22
list is blank the reason behind it because there's a condition mentioned over here assigned to system
55:29
administrator now i have logged in as a system administrator however i don't
55:35
have any ticket assigned to me that's the reason this particular list is empty
55:40
however if i will go to the next module where condition has been changed
55:46
and you can see here it only shows active equal to true that means all the
55:51
incidents which are active right now and that's the reason you can see all this list here you have 48 records
55:59
now how exactly you can change this list now you can change this list with the help of condition so what i will do i
56:06
will just click on directly this particular condition so it is also populating something you can see it says
56:13
click to remove subsequent condition that means whatever conditions are there
56:18
are mentioned after this condition it they will automatically be removed and
56:23
the data will be shown as per this current selection so i will click this all that means it will show all the
56:30
incident rackets of your instance regardless whether it is assigned to you or somebody else
56:38
so this is how you can change the filter now as of now you can see you have 75
56:44
records however the system is showing you on the screen in this particular page only 20 records
56:52
how can you change this this option can be changed with the help of list control where you will click on
56:58
that you will see this option called show once you will put your mouse over that it will show some more options for
57:06
this page how many rackets you want to select whether you want to see 10 records per page 15 20. as of now 20 is
57:14
selected that is the reason you are getting 20 records but if you will select 100 rows then as of now all 75
57:21
records will be displayed to you in just one page and i have clicked on that and
57:28
you can see it says 1 275 out of 75 on this one page this page you have to
57:35
scroll it down but the max limit is 100 that is what servicenow has given so
57:42
this is the main list which we were talking about and the two other options which you have that is one is list
57:49
control where you will see different options and then you have this context menu list context menu and you will see
57:57
some more options now as of now this is the list we have this filter option
58:04
now when you click this filter you will get an opportunity you will get an option to apply the condition
58:11
so you can see here you can apply the condition so for example i want to go
58:16
for maybe caller is
58:23
so here i'm selecting the object then i will i will put what kind of operator i want to use so maybe i will
58:29
use is for now and then i will select fred ludi so i want to see wherever
58:36
caller is fred ludi that means all the incidents where caller is fred ludi i
58:41
should be able to see that data in this particular page so what i need to do i will i have to click on this run now if
58:48
you will not click on run then it won't display the racket for you so here you have to click on run and then it will
58:54
run the filter and then display the records as per the condition you have mentioned here now this is called
59:02
breadcrumb the one which you were talking about here you can add more filters so let's see maybe we can add uh
59:09
and where uh caller is uh fred ludi and then i will put priority
59:16
maybe priority is one so i will select critical and then i
59:21
will apply it again so i will run this now once this is run you can see we have
59:27
this five four incidents in the list where priority is one and caller is fred ludi
59:35
in this case you can see here as well so we have caller fred ludi and priority is
59:40
one so for any list whatever data you are seeing you should always see first filter condition that
59:48
what exactly condition has been applied and then you can change it now this
59:54
condition and filter is basically also on based on the
59:59
so if you really want to put some constraint the user user should not put
1:00:04
any kind of condition here or should not edit this condition you can also do that
1:00:10
as an administrator so i can expand this as well and this is
1:00:15
called breadcrumb now let's see more options which we have on list control and
1:00:22
list context menu so here i i click here i can see view
1:00:27
now this is kind of a view in service now you can create different views
1:00:34
as per your use case here you can see that i have a default
1:00:40
view major incidence view mobile view now how that view is important now view
1:00:45
is important because the data which you are seeing the fields which you are seeing it might happen that as per the view you
1:00:53
might want to change these views that means maybe for major incidents you want to add one more field or maybe you don't
1:01:00
want to show all these fields all these columns so it's totally up to you similarly as a list we also have this
1:01:07
view on form as well then we have filters now you can create
1:01:12
your own filters as well that means you can save them because as of now it is just live filters so you're just
1:01:19
applying it running it and that's it but these filters are not getting saved now
1:01:25
as a user you might be working on a particular filter almost daily in that situation
1:01:32
you don't want to apply that filter every day so what you will do in that case you will save that filter so as of
1:01:39
now you can see i have mentioned fred ludi and one what i will do i will click this button save once you will click
1:01:45
this button save you will see an option save as that means it will ask you to provide a name so maybe i will do test
1:01:55
and then here you have an option that's called visible2 so you can also share
1:02:00
this list that means this favorite with other people as well other users as well maybe your colleague so in this case as
1:02:07
of now you can make it visible to me everyone or you want to share this list with a whole group or something in that
1:02:14
case as of now i'm just keeping me so i will save this once you will save this
1:02:20
it will give you the option yes yes it is saved now now how exactly you can you
1:02:26
can select the same uh filter so in that case i will show you i'm selecting this
1:02:32
all that means this particular list is showing you all the incident records now how can you go and apply your saved
1:02:40
filter in that case you will click here go to filters now here at the bottom you
1:02:45
will see you have this your saved filter just click on it
1:02:51
filter will automatically be applied whatever condition you mentioned while saving your filter it will be displayed
1:02:57
here so now you can see you are getting the same incidents which you were getting before
1:03:02
this is how a user a user can save the filters
1:03:07
and you can create multiple filters as per the user you want then you have group by now as of now you
1:03:14
are seeing this data without grouping now if you want to group this data maybe with the state
1:03:20
then how many how many records you have for on hold closed or in progress in
1:03:26
that case there are two options for this one is you can do it directly from here you can
1:03:32
select the field another option you have you can directly click on that column that field right
1:03:38
click and here you will automatically see the option called group by state
1:03:43
automatically you don't have if i click on here it will show me group by priority so i'm doing it right now for
1:03:50
state i'm clicking this once you will click that you can see the list data has been changed now here you
1:03:57
you're seeing the data as per the states you have it it has grouped the list of records you have on
1:04:05
your screen so this is how you can do for other fields as well as per your requirement
1:04:11
so for example you want to see the data you want to filter them and see how many of rackets you have for a particular
1:04:17
category maybe for a particular state this is how you can you can apply this
1:04:22
groups grouping and then you will get that data accordingly and the next is refresh list where you
1:04:30
can it can refresh the list so maybe for example you're changing something on the
1:04:35
form and you want to just refresh the list whether that has been applied or not in that case you can refresh the
1:04:42
list and the last is favorite now similarly as you added this
1:04:47
uh added this filter you can also create it as a favorite how
1:04:53
can we do that let me show you so i will click on favorite now this pop-up will be displayed here i
1:04:59
can put incidents or maybe test this is quite different
1:05:05
i can also give a color uh here and maybe i can also give an icon if i want
1:05:10
so as often i can just keep it simple i will click on done now once you will click on done
1:05:16
where exactly you will see this favorite so if you remember we learned about
1:05:21
application navigator in application navigator you have second element where you can see all the favorites so if you
1:05:29
will click here and you can see the favorite which i just created and i will
1:05:34
show you quickly so as of now it is displaying all 75 rackets but if i click this favorite
1:05:42
you can see it is showing the same favorite which we just saved
1:05:48
so that's how user can create favorites as well and utilize it for for
1:05:53
daily purpose now the next thing we have is list
1:05:58
context menu so here you have different options you can sort this for example a to z
1:06:06
as per the field you are selecting so if you will select a short description so
1:06:11
it will it will sort the data solve the sort the list alphabetically then you
1:06:16
have ungroup option as well if you want to ungroup you can do that if you want to group it by short description that is
1:06:23
also you can do then you have bar chart so you can create the chart directly from here so
1:06:29
for example if you will click this option it will take you to the bar chart option
1:06:36
that means whatever data you had it will try to create a report but into bar
1:06:42
chart you can see that now it will try to create a bar chart for you
1:06:49
done but as per the data you have selected so let's go back
1:06:57
let's ungroup it i'm going to ungroup it and see the options
1:07:02
then we have pie chart option as well now the next option we have is
1:07:08
configure now this is for service now administrators and developers
1:07:15
so if you want to change anything in your list which we will learn later that how
1:07:21
exactly you can configure your list and your
1:07:26
forms but as of now you can see we have this options you also have other options like all
1:07:34
table security rules business rules these are some or develop other development options which you can
1:07:40
utilize now here we have list control we have list layout now layout is something
1:07:46
the data which you are seeing here the fields which you are seeing here so if you will
1:07:51
click there and go to list layout
1:07:56
you can change this layout as well so for example you want to remove this category for now or maybe this updated
1:08:03
and updated by as well you and as of now you also have this view so i'm doing it
1:08:09
for default view i will click on save
1:08:14
once you will click on save you will see the the data which we just removed is
1:08:20
not being visible here that's how you change the list layout now you can go configure again you have
1:08:27
some list calculation now this is for any kind of calculation maybe you have some data where you want to calculate
1:08:33
something that is something you can do then we have list control now list control is something about the
1:08:38
accessibility and visibility of the buttons and all so if you will click on this list control
1:08:46
you will see that option now here you will see some other options for like new roles that means what roles
1:08:52
should should be able to see new button for this particular list that's what you
1:08:58
can see here edit roles filter roles what people what kind of people what
1:09:03
kind of users can apply the filters that is what you can do here then you have edit as well what users
1:09:10
can edit option uh for for for this particular list that is something you can do here now if you want to omit
1:09:17
filters that means your users should not be able to see the filter that is something you can do here
1:09:24
there are some other options as well which we will learn later because these are some more options for list control
1:09:33
so let's go back to our list
1:09:38
then we have import so if you want to import some data into your list you can
1:09:43
do with this particular option you can also export the data as well from this particular list and you have
1:09:50
some more options here like excel csv xml json pdf now these are some
1:09:56
extensions which you can use for export of this list then we have update selected now this
1:10:03
option is something if you want to update any particular record or maybe multiple records that is something you
1:10:09
can do with the help of this for example if i check these box and i
1:10:16
right click here and i go to update selected i can update a particular
1:10:21
racket it will be updated both records so if i click on update selected
1:10:28
so here it will show you what exactly you want to change so let's see maybe i will change uh
1:10:35
impact and urgency and i will make it one and i will update this ideally this
1:10:43
won't work because there is a there is a pattern which works for impact and urgency
1:10:50
so i'm clicking i am i'm i just clicked on update and it is trying to update
1:10:56
that you can see those two records were updated and that's the reason now i'm
1:11:02
not able to see them in my list because priority is not critical
1:11:08
because priority always it's it's driven by urgency and impact
1:11:14
and that's the reason priority didn't become critical and that's the reason it is not
1:11:21
displayed on this particular list then i go this option you have update
1:11:27
all so for the same way if you want to update all the rackets you have on the screen that is something you can do
1:11:34
you can import the xml data as well and you can also if you want to see the xml
1:11:39
data that you can just that you can do as well so for example if i click on show xml now this is the
1:11:46
xml of your list the data which you have
1:11:52
on on this particular screen now xml won't show you just
1:11:57
these fields or these columns it will show you the whole data you have
1:12:03
for this particular record that means whatever two records which you are seeing here it will be this it will be
1:12:09
showing you all the fields in that xml users can also perform searching in
1:12:15
servers now list there are two options one is on the top you have the search
1:12:22
option where you will see different fields as of now selected in this view
1:12:31
and you can search for any keyword for that particular field you want
1:12:36
another option we have directly just below the field we have the search option as well this can be enabled and
1:12:43
disabled with the help of the search icon if you want to perform any searching you
1:12:50
can just type anything in this particular field and if you type here press enter
1:12:57
search will happen but one of the important thing for the searching is
1:13:03
when you will press enter now this particular searching will automatically be added as part of the
1:13:10
condition of your filter and you can see it says short description starts with atf
1:13:20
users can also personalize the list even if developer or administrator
1:13:28
provides a default list view with specific fields
1:13:33
users should have some options so that they can personalize this list
1:13:39
and that option is from here this settings button when you will click here you will see
1:13:46
this option it says personalize list columns as a user for your view you want to add
1:13:53
any field which is not in default list you can add that as well
1:14:02
so as an example i have added child incidence and category if i click ok
1:14:08
these two fields will be displayed on this view as well
1:14:13
we can see child incidence and category is added so this is how you you work on list and
1:14:21
filters forms in this section we will learn about how
1:14:28
forms shows data from the table component of form
1:14:34
form personalization form customization form templates
1:14:42
forms a form displays information from one
1:14:47
record in a data table as an example you can see that we have
1:14:52
this racket which is showing details of the problem bracket from the problem table
1:14:59
users can edit create specific records as per the access they have in the
1:15:05
system form elements form also has different elements
1:15:14
content frame which is the main section where details of a racket are displayed
1:15:22
form title where you see the information about record and buttons of the form
1:15:31
form menu which shows some menu options to perform some functionalities and configure the
1:15:38
form form buttons
1:15:43
which are also called ui actions which can be utilized to perform some action
1:15:48
on the form let's understand about forms in more details
1:15:54
in my personal developer instance i will show you the forms related to
1:16:01
incident management application which means you will see forms of
1:16:07
incident rackets i will open a random racket of incident
1:16:12
table
1:16:21
this is the form which shows details about a record of incident table
1:16:28
these are the fields which users can provide input while creating or updating
1:16:34
the racket on the form let's create a new record for incident
1:16:43
we have an out of the box module create new under incident application
1:16:52
click this module it will show a new form
1:16:57
once user will provide the input and save the form racket will be created
1:17:03
and is stored in incident table i'm putting the value in caller field
1:17:10
as apple tutor and then short description
1:17:18
so it's form topic
1:17:23
test you will see the submit button on the
1:17:30
top which will save the racket you also have another option so if you
1:17:36
right click on the top that means in title bar of the form you will see this
1:17:42
one more option that is save button now what is the difference between this
1:17:48
submit button and save i will show you quickly so i will just copy
1:17:55
this short description if you will click this submit button
1:18:02
it will save the record however form will be disappeared
1:18:09
and you will go to the back same screen which you had earlier
1:18:15
now let me click on create new again fill the data
1:18:21
so i'm putting caller again and maybe
1:18:26
two three now this time i will click on save
1:18:32
rather than submit button if you will click on save
1:18:37
you see the difference now that form is still there so racket is inserted your
1:18:44
data has been inserted into servicenow table however page is still there
1:18:51
that means page remains there so that's a difference between
1:18:57
save and submit there are two other important elements
1:19:04
on a form mandatory fields and read-only fields
1:19:13
so let me click create new again you will see these two fields
1:19:20
they are quite different from other fields because they don't have asterisk red
1:19:26
asterisk on them and that's the reason these two fields are different
1:19:32
wherever you see these reds asterisk those fields are called mandatory fields
1:19:41
mandatory fields are required to be filled by the user to submit or save the
1:19:47
record in the table then you have read-only fields
1:19:54
one of the read-only field is like this priority field which user cannot edit
1:20:03
so read-only fields are non-editable fields which cannot be edited by the
1:20:08
user on the form so while creating a new form or for any
1:20:14
form like incident change problem you might get requirement from your customers that they have to put some of
1:20:22
the fields they have to make some of the fields read only so that users cannot
1:20:28
edit them it might happen that to edit them they can add some condition as well
1:20:38
forms can also have fields like choice fields
1:20:43
like you can see here we have impact where users can select the value from
1:20:49
drop down option forms also have reference fields
1:20:55
like caller configuration item service
1:21:02
assignment group assign to now these fields are the fields which
1:21:09
shows the value stored in different table
1:21:14
so basically you can select the caller however the data which you can select
1:21:20
on this particular field is basically in a different table now in this case for a caller field it
1:21:27
is basically showing you the data from users table of service now
1:21:35
so i can select any user i want in a reference field
1:21:41
so i can fill test
1:21:47
demo one two three four i can
1:21:52
click here save now once you will save this record
1:21:58
you will see more buttons and you will also see more options
1:22:05
so you can see now buttons got changed you had some different buttons like submit and resolve but after saving you
1:22:12
got more buttons and you also got update create security incident and you also
1:22:17
got delete button and if i talk about options so on the title of the form when you
1:22:24
right click here if you remember while creating a new record
1:22:29
on a new form you just had few options on this particular menu
1:22:35
but now you have a lot of options where you can select
1:22:41
here you have save you have copy incident that means you can also copy
1:22:46
this incident racket so this particular instant record is already created
1:22:53
and if you want to copy this you can do that
1:22:58
you have some other buttons like create problem create request then you have configure form design as
1:23:05
well view show xml history reload form if you want to reload the
1:23:11
form you can also do that so these are different options
1:23:17
if you want to copy you can click here if you want to create problem that is something you can do
1:23:24
now once you have created this incident you can also go for work notes and
1:23:31
comments which basically provide you the details
1:23:37
related to the racket by the users so you will go to notes section
1:23:45
here you can see we have these two fields additional comments and another one i have work notes
1:23:52
you can type something here and then click on post
1:23:57
now these comments and field activities basically they will be captured in
1:24:03
activities and this activity is called activity stream
1:24:10
so whatever changes you are doing maybe you are changing the caller maybe
1:24:15
you're changing the subcategory if you have configured it to show it in the activity stream it
1:24:21
will be captured automatically maybe i'm selecting the assignment group
1:24:27
as well and let me save this record
1:24:33
once you will save that you will see that assigned to an incident state got
1:24:39
captured so this is really helpful so for other users they can at least see the
1:24:45
timelines then what kind of activity was done
1:24:50
form also has sections which are part of the form however some
1:24:57
fields can be grouped in a bucket and they are displayed in a section
1:25:04
so these these fields which you can see here they are part of the form however
1:25:10
they have been grouped in a bucket and then they have showed them showed in a section
1:25:16
like we have related records you have resolution information and then you have this notes section
1:25:25
now at the very bottom of your form you will find related lists
1:25:32
which show the related data from a different table to the current record
1:25:39
so if this particular table has some relationship with other tables
1:25:45
you can add multiple related lists over here and if this particular record is
1:25:52
mentioned somewhere in other table you might see those records here as well
1:26:01
now the display of the fields of the form can be changed as per the view of the
1:26:07
form which is called view so whatever fields you are seeing here
1:26:13
right now they are basically on default view how exactly you check the view so you
1:26:20
click here and you will see this option view
1:26:26
as of now this is default view so it might happen depend on the kind of
1:26:32
access maybe or depend on the kind of information you want to show like for example the best
1:26:39
example i can give you for major incidents now if any incident is kind of a major
1:26:46
incident it's a very priority prioritized incident in that case
1:26:51
as a user of an organization i need more information
1:26:56
so you can change the layout of the form depend on the kind of view you want
1:27:02
and that's totally up to you that how many views you want to create for for
1:27:07
any particular record in in any particular table in servicenow
1:27:14
so you might get different requirements from your customers to create different views for a particular form
1:27:22
form configuration the fields and layout of the form can be
1:27:28
configured servicenow admins can perform this configuration
1:27:35
overall you can change the form design with two different options
1:27:41
one is form layout in which you can create new views new
1:27:46
fields and adjust the layout of the form to be visible for the users
1:27:55
next is form design which is kind of an advanced way to
1:28:00
create the field and adjust design on the form
1:28:06
you can also select the views via form design as well
1:28:11
you can configure the form layout by right click on the title bar of the form
1:28:17
you will see configure option when you will put your mouse on configure you will find these three top
1:28:25
options form design form layout
1:28:30
which we talked about the two options to change the design of the form
1:28:36
and the third one is related list where you can configure your related
1:28:41
list of the form as well and there are some other development
1:28:46
options and configuration options so let's click on form layout
1:28:54
once you will click on form layout you will see this screen the first section which you are seeing
1:29:00
here its selection of the fields on the form so what fields should be visible should be
1:29:07
displayed on the form can be configured with this section in the left hand side you have available
1:29:13
fields so all the available which you can display on the form those are here
1:29:19
on the right hand side you have selected fields that means the fields which were which are already there on the form
1:29:26
you can also select the view from this particular option so here you have view name you can change the view as well if
1:29:33
you will change the view this particular section will automatically update the data as well
1:29:40
so we will keep it default for now and then you have sections
1:29:47
the bucket which you were talking about you can also add the fields as per the sections as well you have on the form
1:29:56
now what exactly you can do via form layout form layout gives you an option to
1:30:03
create the field as well you can change the layout however you
1:30:08
can still add a new field of a specific type
1:30:14
so here you can see another section that's called create new field so you can provide the name of the field
1:30:21
you can select the type of the field you want to create and you can select the field length as
1:30:27
well i will show you quickly one thing so for example if you are selecting reference
1:30:33
field if you will select the reference field it will show you that which table you want to reference
1:30:40
that is something you can select here if you want to go for choice field it will ask you to provide the input for
1:30:47
choices as well you can have any other field like true or false
1:30:54
then that particular field will be removed that option of reference table because this is just a check box but
1:31:02
that's how you can create a new field you just need to type the name
1:31:07
and just click on add it will automatically be added you can change the layout
1:31:13
from here so for example impact and urgency they were in right hand side
1:31:18
now i can change that i will put it at the top maybe just below configuration
1:31:24
item you can see form is basically being splitted between two
1:31:29
so we have splitted the form so now what i will do i will just save this i'm not creating any incident for now
1:31:37
so i'm just leaving this and i am just clicking on save
1:31:42
once you will save that you can see initially we had impact urgency and priority on this side
1:31:49
now we have on left hand side so this is how you can change the form
1:31:55
layout and at the same time you can also create new fields and while creating the new
1:32:01
fields you can also mention where exactly you want to put them on the form even if you don't want to put them on
1:32:06
the form you just need to put them in the available section rather than
1:32:11
selected section so that they won't be visible on the form
1:32:18
so this was about form layout now you can also change the design of the form with another option that is
1:32:25
form design and that's kind of an advanced ui
1:32:30
so if i right click here you will see this configure option
1:32:36
and then you have this form design you click this button
1:32:41
it will open up in a new tab it is loading
1:32:47
it is quite similar the options the functionalities are quite similar however as i mentioned it looks it's
1:32:53
kind of a design and it is also drag and drop there you will keep on selecting them
1:32:59
and putting them at the top here it's kind of just drag and drop so for example if i want these fields here i
1:33:07
can do that i will just drag and drop
1:33:15
this is done and this is done if i want to put them above i can do
1:33:23
that as well so let me do that
1:33:28
yep it is done so i have changed the design now you can also create new field from
1:33:35
here as well so here you have available fields
1:33:41
these are all selected fields these are some formatters now here you have field types so if you
1:33:49
want to create a new field in form design mode you just need to drag that type
1:33:55
like this and that's it so as of now i'm just canceling this and
1:34:01
you can also provide the name so if i put this here i click here i can give it a name as
1:34:09
well so you can give a name here
1:34:16
any name you want and i can just cancel and if you want to make it mandatory and read only you can
1:34:24
directly do it from here and then i can save it
1:34:30
so as of now because i just changed the form layout so i'm just clicking this button if i click this button
1:34:37
it will save the layout and it is done i can cancel this
1:34:44
now you can see it is still here so what exactly you have to do you have to reload the form and you have this option
1:34:50
over here and click this button and this form will be reloaded and now you see that impact
1:34:57
urgency and priority are back to the same position which we had earlier so
1:35:03
this is how you utilize form layout and form design to configure the form
1:35:11
another part is related list configuration so right click here
1:35:17
go to configure and you will find this option related list now the important point is what exactly
1:35:24
it will change so this will change the bottom section you have here so as
1:35:30
of now you have task sla and security incidents what i will do i will go here
1:35:36
into related list here you will have all the data all the relationships you have in the available
1:35:42
section and the selected part is here what i will do i will try to maybe just
1:35:49
pull one or two related list in left in right hand side in selected section and
1:35:55
i will just save it once you will save this you will see at
1:36:02
the bottom you have other two related list as well which you just added
1:36:08
so this is how you can configure a related list for a form
1:36:15
let me also show you the configuration of a list
1:36:20
so let's go to a list all open records all open incidents
1:36:26
basically now here you have an option of configure again and you have this list layout list
1:36:34
calculation and list control so let me show you for list layout as well
1:36:44
so you have these fields available on the list i might need assignment group or assign two as well
1:36:51
if i click save you will see that assignment group and a site 2 has been
1:36:58
added as well via list layout you must have seen that you can also
1:37:05
create new fields so even while list layout it is it gives
1:37:10
you an opportunity to create field as well
1:37:17
so this is how you can configure list as well that whatever fields you want to see
1:37:23
whatever field you want to display to your users you can do that with the help of list configuration
1:37:30
service now also provides a functionality in which users can create rackets with
1:37:37
the help of templates these templates can be created
1:37:42
and defined with specific fields with specific data into those fields
1:37:50
as an example if you create similar kind of incidents every day
1:37:56
with specific fields same options same values in the fields you have on
1:38:03
incident form so out of 20 fields maybe you normally use same kind of values for 10 fields
1:38:12
that means you are creating them every day in this case servicenow gives you an
1:38:18
opportunity a functionality in which you can create a template for those those
1:38:23
10 fields and create a new template and then you can apply the template while creating a
1:38:29
new record you can create that template
1:38:37
in a template section so let me show you you click create new button
1:38:42
once you will click on this create new button you will see this new form on the top you will see these three dots
1:38:50
those are more options if you click this you will see this option called toggle
1:38:56
template bar when you say toggle template bar when you click this button you will see this
1:39:02
bar will be displayed as of now this was not displayed so you
1:39:08
have to enable this option as of now you have two
1:39:13
templates available if you want to create new templates you can also do that from here but you
1:39:19
already have that which you can create incident it says incident call type if i click
1:39:26
this you will see some of the fields which automatically be filled it says incident call type template applied and
1:39:34
you can see it it applies this particular value so here we have contact type as self
1:39:40
service initially it was different so let me reload it again
1:39:46
as of now it says none but when i will apply this template the value will be posed automatically
1:39:55
so templates are pretty much important functionality in service now so whenever you want to create some
1:40:01
records every day maybe frequently in that case you can utilize these templates
1:40:08
servers now also provide you the functionality in addition to this templates that you can schedule these
1:40:14
templates as well that means if you want to create a specific record
1:40:21
on a specific time every day with the specific field values
1:40:26
you can also do that and that's called schedule templates
1:40:32
so that's how you utilize templates in service now this is part 3.1
1:40:40
which is a knowledge check session after learning couple of topics
1:40:46
you will find these kind of knowledge checks in your training
1:40:52
in this knowledge check you will find 10 questions and you will get 10 seconds to thank for
1:40:59
the answer and then answer will be displayed on the screen
1:41:06
let's start with the first question that is which application is visible to
1:41:12
the users with no roles in servicenow instance time starts now
1:41:28
an answer is self service let's go to next question
1:41:36
edge is visible in ui 15 or ui 16
1:41:41
your time starts now
1:41:54
answer is ui 15
1:41:59
next question we have is the primary way to access servicenow platform data and
1:42:06
information
1:42:18
platform native ui question number four
1:42:23
a role should be added to the user directly is it true or false your time starts now
1:42:40
false roles should be added to a group as a standard practice
1:42:46
question number five what is a role in servicenow
1:42:53
your time starts
1:43:03
collection of permissions a role is a collection of permissions
1:43:10
question number six name two baseline system roles your time
1:43:16
starts now
1:43:27
item role and admin role these are two baseline system roles in
1:43:33
service now question number seven
1:43:39
where user profile is located
1:43:53
banner frame question number eight
1:43:58
which button save the new record and close the form your time starts now
1:44:14
submit button question number nine which button can copy the incident
1:44:22
and creates a new incident record your time starts now
1:44:38
copy incident button you'll find this button on incident form in the incident
1:44:44
form menu you will find this particular button question number 10 and this is the last
1:44:50
question of this knowledge check session what are two ways of doing form
1:44:57
configuration your time starts
1:45:10
form layout and form design these are the two options by which you
1:45:17
can do the form configurations task management
1:45:23
service now is all about managing tasks in this section we will learn how
1:45:30
servicenow platform helps you to get all those tasks done across the enterprise
1:45:38
we will learn about task assignment how exactly you can collaborate to
1:45:44
complete a task how you can manage different tasks in
1:45:49
servicenow
1:45:55
what is a task a task is any record that can be
1:46:00
assigned or completed by a user in service now
1:46:07
users create tasks and are notified as the task moves along a workflow
1:46:14
tasks can be assigned to a specific user or user groups
1:46:21
tasks can be an incident record a problem bracket or a request
1:46:29
task is required to be created to track the action and progress for a work
1:46:34
assigned to any particular team or individual as an example it team has to resolve a
1:46:43
user's computer issue another example hr team has to onboard a
1:46:49
new joiner these are kind of tasks for specific
1:46:54
teams for which you need some kind of a racket some kind of a system which can track
1:47:02
the progress of those tasks
1:47:08
task workflow let's take an example
1:47:15
tisha is an application support engineer of an organization
1:47:21
while working her computer stopped working and she's worried about completion of
1:47:27
work she has to do she raised an incident for the issue she
1:47:34
was getting and that particular incident got
1:47:39
assigned to itt and then once that incident was assigned
1:47:46
to itt then it got routed to john who is an i.t specialist
1:47:53
and work on those type of issues which tisha was getting
1:47:59
so that was one of the issue which john basically resolved them
1:48:07
john started working on the issue and got the reason for the issue
1:48:13
so that means he tried to troubleshoot the issue and he finally got the what exactly the
1:48:19
problem was he resolved the issue of tisha by taking the remote off of her
1:48:27
computer and finally issue was resolved successfully
1:48:33
he changed the state of the incident to resolved in servicenow system
1:48:40
and finally tisha got an email from servicenow that her issue got resolved
1:48:48
and she was very happy with the kind of service she got
1:48:53
so this is what task management is about
1:48:58
so that you can track the progress of any work assigned to any individual or
1:49:04
teams task table the task table is one of servicenow's
1:49:11
core tables any table which is a type of task
1:49:17
is mostly extended from task table like incident table
1:49:24
request table and change table
1:49:29
we have other tables as well which are extended from task table like problem
1:49:35
table request item table all these tables are basically kind of a
1:49:42
task which has to be assigned to someone so the people can work upon it
1:49:51
functionalities associated with tasks a lot of additional functionalities
1:49:58
which are basically associated with the task
1:50:03
like approvals which is basically depend on the
1:50:09
requirement so a task can be assigned for an approval or multiple approvals
1:50:17
which can be generated manually or automatically as per the approval rules
1:50:24
service now provides a feature to use different types of approvals via
1:50:29
workflow which we will learn later
1:50:36
assignments tasks are supposed to be assigned to someone
1:50:43
so that somebody can work on those tasks and perform some actions as per the type
1:50:50
of task now this assignment can be done manually
1:50:56
or with the help of some automation or automatic rules those are called assignment rules and service now
1:51:06
now users need to make sure the task is assigned to the right team or individual
1:51:13
so even if you are doing automatically or you are doing manually you have to
1:51:18
make sure that even you are putting some rules for automatic assignment
1:51:24
that you are putting the right rules so the ticket is assigned to the right teams
1:51:31
and the third additional functionality is sla service level agreement
1:51:40
so sla is basically used to track the services provided by any team working on
1:51:47
a task sla highlights if duration of work completed is
1:51:53
ask for the agreed timelines or not else sla will be treated as
1:52:00
breached as an example if database team needs to resolve priority one issues in
1:52:08
one hour then ticket assigned to them will have
1:52:13
resolution sla of one hour and if ticket is not resolved in one
1:52:19
hour then sla will not be met and will be treated as breached
1:52:26
the service now has separate tables to track all these additional
1:52:32
functionalities approvals sla and assignments as well
1:52:41
task assignment a task can be assigned to a group
1:52:48
or a user now that user should be part of the
1:52:54
group so that he can work on the same task
1:53:01
but at the same time user who has been assigned that particular task task should also have
1:53:08
access on that particular table
1:53:13
at the same time for that task record as well
1:53:19
if user even if incident or any task is assigned to a particular user
1:53:24
however he doesn't have access to that particular record then user cannot work
1:53:30
on it so access is very important in this case
1:53:37
now it depends what kind of access you have applied in your instance
1:53:44
we will talk about access rules in our future sections
1:53:49
let's see task table and its other extended tables
1:53:55
for that i will go to tables module which is under system definition
1:54:01
i will click here this will show me the list of tables which we have in our instance
1:54:09
so i have around 3567 tables in my instance currently
1:54:16
these are all out of the box tables provided by servicenow let me show you
1:54:21
the task table which we were talking about which is one of the core table
1:54:27
so here we have this table task table the label of this table is task
1:54:34
and name is task so this is the core table
1:54:40
which is basically not extended from any other table so this is kind of a parent table
1:54:47
however lot of other tables are basically extending from this table
1:54:53
so if i go back and i will show you the list at the top
1:54:59
so you will see we have label name we have name and then we have extend table
1:55:04
that means this table is basically extended from which parent table that is something you
1:55:11
can see here so if i just sort task table and i just click on
1:55:18
show matching now this particular list is showing you
1:55:24
all the tables basically which are getting extended from task table
1:55:30
and the examples which you were talking about like incident problem
1:55:36
change you can see all those tables here you will see request as well requested
1:55:42
item you have catalog task now all these tables are basically extended from task
1:55:48
table now what exactly extension means
1:55:56
whatever fields you will see in this particular table let's take a look if i click here
1:56:02
now these are all fields of tasks table the parent tasks table
1:56:09
as an example like assignment group and business duration or maybe assigned to
1:56:14
if i go back and i open any extended table from task
1:56:19
maybe incident you will see similar kind of fields as well
1:56:26
and some fields specifically created for this table
1:56:32
so whenever a table is extended from a task table or any other table
1:56:38
it basically inherits all the fields of parent table at the same time you can also create
1:56:46
specific fields for that particular table let me show you the assignment fields of
1:56:52
task table so i will go to task table as of now we
1:56:58
are in incident table so i will go to task table here we have assigned to
1:57:04
you can see it is referencing to user table that means you can select any user
1:57:11
and then we have assignment group where you have referencing to group table that means
1:57:17
you can select any group on any task in that case let me just go to the list
1:57:24
of tasks so if i go to the list now this particular list
1:57:30
it's showing you all the tasks of your instance
1:57:36
even its incident even its change even its problem even its request all the t all the records all
1:57:43
the racket tables which are basically extended from task table those records
1:57:49
will be displayed in this particular list you can also see with the help of type
1:57:55
that what are the different types you have different tasks type
1:58:01
that you can see with the help of task type so i will just click here and do it
1:58:07
group by task type when i click this button group by task type
1:58:13
now it will try to group all the records which i have in my instance
1:58:18
so you can see these are the different types of tasks i have currently in my instance
1:58:25
you might have more it depends because this is just out of the box instance i have so i have not maybe
1:58:31
created a lot of records and other tables maybe accept incident table so you can see we have change requests
1:58:38
we have changed tasks we have incident problem problem task request these are
1:58:44
all tables which are basically extended from task table
1:58:50
if i go to incident you can see we have all these incidents and if i just
1:58:55
open any particular racket maybe this one
1:59:01
as of now this is closed so here state is closed however the important part
1:59:06
here is you have this assignment group and then you have this assigned to
1:59:12
so this assigned assignment group is basically assigned to a group and this particular person should be
1:59:19
part of this group and this incident is assigned to this particular
1:59:24
user let me go little bit bottom i was talking about task sla
1:59:31
so this is what we have as part of the related list if you will create sla
1:59:39
then that sla will be attached automatically as per the records or as
1:59:44
per the sla condition you have in your instance let's see other records you might have
1:59:51
some uh other records where we have sla enabled let me quickly check so i will
1:59:58
try to open this record and if i go a little bit bottom
2:00:04
so answer is yes so we do have a sla record in this particular incident
2:00:11
so this is what sla i was talking about as of now this one is priority one
2:00:17
resolution sla now the duration the time is something configurable which you have to configure
2:00:24
as per your customer requirement as per your organizational uh incident
2:00:29
management process and different process you have servicenow also comes up with this sla
2:00:36
definition configuration where you have this module this application called service level
2:00:43
management where you can configure all these slas for different tables for
2:00:49
different tasks for example if i go here and i select here you can see i can also
2:00:55
select the table so here you can select the table for which table you want to track these slas
2:01:05
let's see approvals so if i go back to my record
2:01:12
or maybe i will show you in request one so i will go to
2:01:18
service catalog in request you might find some approvals
2:01:24
maybe here we have this approvers as of now this is empty
2:01:30
but if this particular item would would need to have any kind of approvals then that approver will automatically be
2:01:36
attached that means that record will automatically be shown here and that approver will also get some
2:01:43
emails that yes he has to approve this particular request
2:01:49
you can also add approvals manually if i click this edit button i
2:01:54
will be able to add approvers so let me show you how exactly you can
2:02:00
add so maybe i will add this one if i will add it will automatically create a record
2:02:06
as of now it is not yet requested if you want to make it requested you can
2:02:11
also do that so if i make it requested and just save
2:02:18
it that means now this is in requested state and this approver will get an
2:02:24
email that he has to request something and users can go into servicenow
2:02:29
instance or maybe they can also approve it with the help of email you can see i also i'm because i'm i have logged in as
2:02:36
an administrator so i'm also getting a button to approve or reject
2:02:43
let me quickly show you that how exactly servicenow gives a functionality to add
2:02:48
approvals via workflow as well so if i go to
2:02:54
workflow here i have workflow
2:03:01
so change management request always needs an approval
2:03:07
so let me go to this one so we have this one of the workflow for change
2:03:12
management application that means all the change request which needs approval
2:03:18
so i'm just opening this record so here we have approvals you can see we have this
2:03:24
change approval policy we have some of the some some other activities where you have action like
2:03:31
approval action you can approve it uh reject it that's how you can add
2:03:37
approvals so you can create new workflow and then you can add approvals for any particular
2:03:44
task so if you want to drive your task system
2:03:49
whatever task you are creating even it's a custom or out of the box and you want to add some workflows and you want to
2:03:56
utilize approvals then you can utilize it with the help of workflows as well
2:04:02
phase of task assignment tasks can be assigned to a group or a
2:04:09
user in different ways manually
2:04:14
in which a servicenow user can assign the task to himself
2:04:20
or his own group or another system user can assign to
2:04:25
other user or group of the system then we have assignment rules
2:04:33
they are pre-built functionalities by service now which support setting the value of assigned to
2:04:39
and assignment group field on the task record that is also automatically on the basis
2:04:46
of some rules defined by servicenow admins then predictive intelligence
2:04:55
it is a feature of servicenow platform based on machine learning
2:05:00
which reads the his existing historical data and updates the field like assigned to
2:05:06
an assignment group that means it is totally based on
2:05:11
machine learning and last we have custom rules or script
2:05:18
so servicenow administrators and developers can create their own custom
2:05:24
scripts and rules to update the assignment group and assigned to automatically on the basis of some
2:05:32
condition which is provided as part of the business requirement
2:05:39
manual task assignment users can assign the task manually to a
2:05:45
group or an individual they can update the fields assignment
2:05:51
group and assign to manually on the form let me open an existing incident
2:06:00
so i go to incident module so here i have incident application so i
2:06:07
will just open any existing incident
2:06:15
here you have assignment group and assigned to in order to assign an incident
2:06:23
i should have access to the incident application
2:06:28
which means you should have idle access which is assigned to users to give
2:06:33
access to idle applications like incident change problem
2:06:40
as of now i have logged in as an admin i can assign this particular
2:06:46
ticket to any assignment group now that is called manual assignment
2:06:53
you can see the assigned to already got removed automatically
2:06:58
if i save this that means now in table in database this up assignment
2:07:04
group will be populated like this is stored in the database now let me quickly impersonate itel user
2:07:12
and show you that how exactly idle user can utilize the application
2:07:18
what applications are visible to them and how exactly they can do this assignment manually
2:07:26
in order to impersonate servicenow has this particular
2:07:31
functionality under profile section you have this impersonate user if i
2:07:37
click this button i will see that which particular user i have to
2:07:42
impersonate so i will select this idle user which is already there
2:07:48
which was in my history now as of now this view is basically off
2:07:54
itel user and if i show you what all applications
2:07:59
are visible you will definitely see limited applications
2:08:04
not like the applications which were visible to servicenow administrator
2:08:10
here we have incident change problem configuration and some other applications which are
2:08:16
basically supposed to be visible to idle users the user who has that idle role
2:08:25
if i open any existing incident so
2:08:31
let me just open any existing incident now as an idle user
2:08:37
i can assign this incident manually to any particular group and to any
2:08:43
individual as well as i mentioned earlier
2:08:49
assignment rules are used to automatically set a value in assigned to
2:08:54
and assignment group field of a task record service now comes up with two modules
2:09:02
for assignment rules one is assignment lookup
2:09:08
and assignment we can configure the rackets to automate the assignment of task in different
2:09:14
tasks table like incident problem or request tables
2:09:21
i have logged in as an system administrator you can find assignment rule under
2:09:28
system policy
2:09:36
under system policy you have rules and then you will see two modules
2:09:43
assignment lookup rules and assignment let me show you first assignment
2:09:52
so if i click this you will see existing rackets
2:09:58
that means servicenow has already provided out of the box
2:10:03
some out-of-the-box rules for different tables like change request
2:10:09
incident problem let me open one record
2:10:16
here you can see we have two sections one is applies to
2:10:23
where you mention the table and condition of triggering of auto assignment
2:10:29
that means you have to mention which particular table you have to select for this rule
2:10:37
and then you have to put the trigger triggering condition when exactly
2:10:42
that assignment rule should trigger that is something you mentioned in this
2:10:47
particular section and the next section we have is
2:10:52
assigned to that once that condition is met and that will trigger the assignment
2:10:59
rule then which particular group or user this ticket should be assigned to
2:11:06
so here you can mention the user as well you can also mention group
2:11:12
and the third section we have is related to the script if you're not able to configure the
2:11:19
options and you're not able to achieve the goal which you want to achieve as part of
2:11:24
this assignment rule then you can also do some scripting so this is how you create assignment
2:11:31
rule another module we have is assignment lookup rules
2:11:38
which is basically for incident and if i open this existing record so we
2:11:44
have one record which is out of the box created by servicenow here we have category of incident we
2:11:51
have sub category you can mention configuration item at the same time you can also mention
2:11:58
assignment group and assign to that means if category will be this if
2:12:05
subcategory will be email and configuration item if you want to put anything in that case the ticket
2:12:12
will automatically be assigned to the group which will be selected here it
2:12:17
is just an additional functionality to look up for the different records so that assignment can be done
2:12:24
by these two modules predictive intelligence
2:12:31
service now comes up with out of the box module that is called predictive intelligence
2:12:38
which uses machine learning algorithm to determine field values during record
2:12:44
creation existing data rackets are required to train machine learning to make effective
2:12:52
decisions predictive intelligence is used to populate the following fields like
2:12:58
category priority assignment group and assign to
2:13:05
if you want to learn more about predictive intelligence then you can refer servicenow documentation they have
2:13:13
a lot of information about predictive intelligence you can also found more
2:13:20
details about predictive intelligence in now learning option as well
2:13:27
now learning portal let me show you the predictive intelligence module
2:13:34
before i show you predictive intelligence module it is important to know
2:13:40
predictive intelligence has to be enabled separately via a plugin
2:13:48
so you won't find in your instance by default when you will get new service now instance you have to enable it
2:13:57
moreover it is a licensed application
2:14:02
in that case you have to even for your organization you have to purchase it first you have the guide you have to get
2:14:08
the license first and then you can utilize it and use it in your service now instance
2:14:15
so if i go in application navigator and type here predictive
2:14:20
you will see this module here so this is the module for predictive
2:14:26
intelligence here basically servicenow has given you option that how exactly you can train
2:14:33
your instance to read the data and then it can automatically perform
2:14:39
these assignments in the system without any manual intervention
2:14:45
custom rules or script now this is one of the way as well
2:14:52
where you can automatically perform the assignment for different tasks
2:14:59
in this case you have to write some custom configuration maybe script depends on the kind of
2:15:06
requirement you have and system will automatically update
2:15:11
these two fields with the help of customization you can update a lot of other fields but as we
2:15:18
are just talking about task assignment so you can do this task assignment automatically as well with the help of
2:15:26
custom rules and script service desk application
2:15:32
service now provides an application called service desk which is specifically for all users who
2:15:40
work on different tasks like incident request change problem
2:15:46
etc it is one module where users can access all their tasks regardless of type of
2:15:54
task if the record table is extended from task table
2:16:00
and assigned to a user or group then users in assign to field or part of
2:16:06
the assigned group can see those records in this application
2:16:12
let's take a look in application navigator you need to type
2:16:19
service desk
2:16:25
now this is the application where you can access all the tasks assigned to you or to your
2:16:33
group and that's the reason the name has been given as service desk
2:16:39
the modules we have for this application is callers where you can see all the users of your
2:16:47
system this is idle view so all the users we have that is something you can see
2:16:55
then we have incidents you can see all the incidents because incidents are more important because
2:17:02
they are issues which you have to see on priority then you have knowledge
2:17:08
you can access different knowledge records then you have a module which says my
2:17:14
work now anything assigned to you you can directly see in my work
2:17:20
regardless of task type even its incident even its change even
2:17:26
its problem a request any task you can see here
2:17:31
that means you don't have to worry about different applications for different task types
2:17:37
just click this button you will see all the list whatever task assigned to you
2:17:43
now if you are a member of 10 groups and those 10 groups basically work for
2:17:49
different task type maybe like incident change problem request
2:17:54
how can you see that then we have my group's work
2:17:59
now any task assigned to your group that means you are part of that particular group that you can see here even it is a
2:18:07
sign it is not assigned to you then you have my approvals
2:18:13
so anything which is waiting for your approval any task that is something you can see here
2:18:20
and next module we have which is related to the sla because that is also very
2:18:25
important so we have this sla if i click here it says
2:18:30
my work again and then i have my groups work
2:18:36
this is for sla whichever task where maybe
2:18:42
ticket is being bridged or what exactly the sla going on that is something you can see here
2:18:49
it is not targeting to incident or any task table it is targeting to task sla table
2:18:56
so you can see all the slas running on your task which are basically assigned
2:19:01
to you in my work and assigned to your group that is in my group's work
2:19:08
effective task management in order to manage the tasks effectively
2:19:15
users agents who actually work on the task need to utilize additional functionalities on
2:19:23
the task record like work notes and comments
2:19:30
which are basically used to update the progress of action to complete the task
2:19:36
agents who work on task use work nodes to update the action
2:19:42
and update the comments to provide update to the requester then we have activity stream
2:19:49
activity stream is something which shows all the activities performed for the task like update of a
2:19:56
field update work notes comments sending of an email
2:20:02
now all those activities will be shown in activity stream
2:20:08
so users can see the timelines and what activity was done at what time
2:20:14
and then we have email functionality servicenow comes with email
2:20:20
functionality which allows users and agents to send custom emails to different users
2:20:28
you can send a particular email a custom email you can also attach a document in
2:20:33
that email and send to any user which is basically related to that
2:20:39
particular task in this case if you can see on the screen we have this compose email where
2:20:46
we have all different fields for two cc bcc subject and then we have a body as
2:20:52
well where you can type whatever content you have to put for that email
2:20:57
so these are some additional functionalities which you can utilize
2:21:03
let me show you in my personal developer instance let me impersonate as an idle user
2:21:10
so i will go here i will impersonate ital user
2:21:19
so let's say this idle user wants to see what all incidents he has
2:21:25
got in his queue so for that i will go to service desk
2:21:31
and i will go to my work so these are all tasks which are assigned to me that
2:21:38
means this particular user so if i open this incident where it says
2:21:44
sales forecast spreadsheet is read only it is kind of an incident issue for a
2:21:50
user and user is here that is caller i have this number these are categories
2:21:56
subcategory the fields related to incident i have state impact urgency
2:22:03
now these all are fields which are mostly inherited from task table we have
2:22:08
assignment group we have assigned to now to work on this particular incident
2:22:13
effectively a hack i can change the state as per the action i am taking if i
2:22:19
am doing some action so maybe i can just put the work notes that i have
2:22:25
started working on it
2:22:30
and i can just post this work note and you can see here so if my manager or somebody else wants
2:22:37
to just check if something is going on or not they can just check here
2:22:43
if they won't find something in this activity stream then they can definitely ask
2:22:48
this particular user the why you have not taken any action yet and if i will say yes i have taken the action
2:22:56
then then user might ask my manager can ask them why you have not put in the comments and that is the reason it is
2:23:02
really important because nobody has to reach out to you if you will put something important action here they
2:23:10
don't have to reach out to you in that case if i talk about additional comments if you will check additional
2:23:15
comments now this particular field will automatically be changed and converted into additional comments then you will
2:23:22
not be able to see work notes here if you will type something now this will go to the user
2:23:28
so what if for example you want to ask some kind of screenshot from the user you want to communicate to the user that
2:23:34
you are working upon it in that case you can put something here and it will be sent to the user
2:23:40
so that is a difference between work notes and additional comments
2:23:46
and here we have this activity stream so if i type something maybe i'm just typing test and if i post
2:23:53
something here and if i reload
2:24:01
let's see if if email is being sent or not
2:24:06
so as of now you can see these logs so we have this additional comment we have this work note another functionality to work
2:24:14
effectively is email so if i click these three dots you will see this email
2:24:21
option if i click this it will open a pop-up where i can see that compose new email it will
2:24:28
automatically select the caller but here everything will be blank so you can put any email address you can also
2:24:34
search for the user you can change the subject line if it's up to you but this will basically be
2:24:39
sent from here and as i uh if i just mentioned test here and i just click on
2:24:45
send it will be sent at the same time it will be also tracked in the activity stream
2:24:52
so let's see if it happens or not i'm just reloading it
2:24:58
i think as of now it's not sending the email it should send
2:25:04
but let me refresh again
2:25:09
maybe this user i think this user has not enabled that feature maybe to get
2:25:15
the notification yes and that is what i was i was thinking you can see it says notification disable
2:25:24
i can enable it quickly and i will show you this same incident and
2:25:29
show you how exactly it works so let me just impersonate this user
2:25:38
and if i go to my profile
2:25:45
i have this allow notification so this was disabled for this user i have enabled it i will
2:25:53
just impersonate itel user now so that you can see that
2:26:00
and if i go to my work and i see the same incident here
2:26:09
this time let me see okay so you can see email was sent
2:26:15
because that was disabled so in that case he was not able to get the email but now it is enabled and you can see
2:26:22
that email was sent to the user it has also been captured in the activity
2:26:29
stream now all the activities which are being triggered you can see here the number of
2:26:34
activities as well if you will see 10 activities here so it will show 10
2:26:40
number 10 count here so these are the additional functionalities which are really
2:26:46
important to to work on the task by any agents and end
2:26:52
users notifications in this section we will learn about how
2:26:59
servicenow platform sends notification to users on different events
2:27:05
how you can manage users notification how can you create a new notification
2:27:13
and we will also learned about inbound actions
2:27:20
outbound and inbound when records are created
2:27:27
updated or any event is generated
2:27:32
servicenow can send notifications to the users configured in those notifications
2:27:38
servers now send a notification which is received by a user
2:27:44
and this is called outbound notification for example incident is assigned to a
2:27:52
group then all group members will get email notification about the assignment
2:27:57
of the ticket in their queue users can also respond to the email
2:28:02
received or create new email and send it to servicenow
2:28:09
which can basically perform some action on the records of table which is called inbound action
2:28:16
as an example users can mark an email to your instance email address and
2:28:21
servicenow can process that email and create incident record and populate the fields as per the
2:28:28
information mentioned in the email notification application
2:28:35
service now provides an out-of-the-box module for managing notifications
2:28:42
you can create and manage different types of notifications with this module
2:28:48
let's see the notification application in my personal developer instance
2:28:54
you need to go to application navigator and type system
2:29:00
notification
2:29:06
you will find this system notification application this application has three different
2:29:13
sections for different modules
2:29:19
email which has modules related to email notifications
2:29:25
then we have push which has modules related to mobile push
2:29:31
notifications and lastly we have provider
2:29:37
in which you have modules to configure notifications for agent workspace and
2:29:43
virtual agent which are separate applications of servicenow if you want to
2:29:49
get more details about these applications then please refer service now
2:29:54
documentation site the first module in email section we
2:30:00
have is digest intervals in which you can define the intervals
2:30:07
for digest email functionality email digest is used to reduce the
2:30:13
number of emails sent to the users for specific notifications in a given time
2:30:19
period if digest email is selected then instead of sending multiple
2:30:25
notifications whenever notification conditions are met users will only receive a single notification
2:30:34
which is sent in a specific time period and that time period you can mention
2:30:39
here digest email content is also different
2:30:44
from standard notification and it can be configured separately
2:30:52
then you can see notifications module which shows the list of notifications of
2:30:59
your instance these are all out of the box notifications
2:31:06
you will also see a new button at the top and you can create new notification with
2:31:13
the help of this button next module we have is notification
2:31:20
email scripts which shows the list of email scripts for notifications
2:31:27
these are all out of the box email scripts we will learn about mail scripts later
2:31:34
part of the training then we have notification categories
2:31:42
servicenow has created out of the box categories for notifications
2:31:50
and also provided option to select category for various notifications on notification form
2:31:59
this basically helps to identify your different notifications in the instance
2:32:06
and this module shows the list of categories which are out of the box
2:32:11
and you also have this new button so if you want to create new category for your different notifications you can
2:32:18
do that as well then we have templates
2:32:26
this module shows the list of all email templates created for different notifications
2:32:34
email templates are basically reusable content for subject and message body
2:32:42
servicenow admins can create these templates and use them in different notifications
2:32:51
then we have notification filters this module shows list of filters for
2:32:58
notifications users can filter the notifications by
2:33:04
applying them in notification preference you can click on settings button at the
2:33:11
right top then you will see this pop-up you have to click on notification
2:33:19
once you will click on notification you will see these options so you have to select any any kind of notification
2:33:26
maybe for it service management once you will click that you will find multiple notification for that module
2:33:33
and you can just click on maybe this particular notification and click again
2:33:40
then you will see to apply some conditions now in conditions you have an option to select the filter
2:33:49
and here we have critical issues filter and we also have unsubscribe filter
2:33:54
which are basically available in our list
2:34:00
so users can basically apply these filters to get the notifications accordingly
2:34:09
and lastly we have an email section as email access restriction
2:34:16
this module shows the rules created to restrict access of email notifications
2:34:24
when email is sent from servicenow it creates a login service now
2:34:30
i will show you quickly so just go to emails if you type emails
2:34:36
under system logs you will see these emails this is the module which shows the logs
2:34:42
of the email sent if i just click on all because as of now it has already applied a filter for all
2:34:50
emails of today but this will remove the filter and will show all the emails which were sent from
2:34:57
this instance so you have this list of emails sent or
2:35:02
received in your instance so if you want to restrict access to
2:35:08
specific types of notifications like password emails approval emails then you
2:35:14
can apply those rules and then notifications will be only visible to the users mentioned in the rules
2:35:23
we also have other modules for push notification and the other one
2:35:29
is just for provider where you configure for agent workspace and virtual agent
2:35:36
out of the box notifications servicenow also has out-of-the-box
2:35:42
notifications configured for existing modules and applications provided by
2:35:47
servicenow like incident notifications change notifications
2:35:53
problem management notifications or request notifications servicenow admins can edit existing
2:36:00
notifications or they can create new notifications you can access notifications via module
2:36:07
notifications under system notification
2:36:13
and the table where all these notifications are stored as cis event
2:36:19
underscore email so this is the table says event underscore email underscore
2:36:26
action that's the name of the table in which all these notifications are
2:36:32
stored notification form servicenow admins can create new
2:36:38
notifications so let's talk about the fields used to configure these notifications
2:36:47
starting with the first field we have is name you need to provide the name of your notification in this field
2:36:57
then we have table you need to select the table for which notification needs to be sent like
2:37:04
incident table problem table change table or request table
2:37:09
and many more category you can define the category of your
2:37:15
notifications and service now has out of the box categories as well like service
2:37:21
catalog approvals and some categories which are based on the modules
2:37:28
notification form has three important sections which basically drives the whole
2:37:34
notification the first section we have is when to send
2:37:41
where you define the condition when the event should trigger and notification should be sent
2:37:50
then we have who will receive section where you define who all are the
2:37:57
recipients of the notification and the last section we have is what it
2:38:03
will contain in this section you have fields to define content you want to send via this
2:38:09
notification you can mention subject message body and
2:38:15
some other elements for your notification let's see the fields of this section
2:38:23
in the first section when to send you have a field called send when
2:38:30
in this field you need to mention when notification will be sent
2:38:36
so there are three options available in this particular field
2:38:42
when record is inserted or updated and when this option is selected
2:38:49
notifications will be sent based on insert or update of record whichever is
2:38:55
checked as we have two other fields updated and inserted
2:39:01
the second option is event when this option is selected then you
2:39:06
also need to select the event and notifications are sent when selected event is triggered in the instance
2:39:14
servicenow developers and admins can create this event via scripting
2:39:22
a last choice of this field is triggered which is triggered by a flow designer
2:39:31
next section is who will receive in this section you have fields like
2:39:37
users groups and user group field as you know you need to define
2:39:44
recipients of the notification in this section so you can select individual users in users field
2:39:50
individual groups in group field and select the field of user and group
2:39:56
on the form and table for which notification is created
2:40:02
we have one more field called subscribeable so if you want to make the notification
2:40:09
subscribeable that means users can subscribe for your notification then you can check the checkbox of this field
2:40:17
and that is subscribable last section we have is
2:40:23
what it will contain in this section we have fields like
2:40:29
content type in which you select type of your message content like html plain text
2:40:36
or html and plain text then we have include attachments which
2:40:41
will send all attachments in the email of the record if checked
2:40:47
omit watermark servicenow can create a random alphanumeric code and add it at the
2:40:53
bottom of every email notification and show it as watermark for every email
2:40:59
notification if this field is checked then no watermark will be added in the
2:41:05
notification push message only
2:41:12
we talked about mobile app in service now when a notification is created it
2:41:19
basically sent as an email and also send as a push notification on the mobile app
2:41:26
if this option is checked then email notification will not be sent and the notification will only be used
2:41:33
for post notification
2:41:40
importance you have option to send email with importance as high or low
2:41:48
and that's what you can select in this field from field
2:41:55
by default email is sent from servicenow with email address which is instance name
2:42:00
at servicenow.com however if you want any email address of
2:42:06
your organization then you can add that in this particular field and users will
2:42:12
get the notification from that email for this particular notification which you
2:42:17
are creating reply to you can also put if you want users to
2:42:24
reply to any other email then you put that email address in this
2:42:31
field else same email from which user received email will be used for reply to
2:42:40
push messages push messages are the content for mobile notifications
2:42:47
you can create them separately and select in this field
2:42:52
email template the content of the email can send in two ways
2:42:58
one is you directly mention it in the field like subject and method html
2:43:04
or you can also create templates and select them to send the notification
2:43:12
and the last thing we have on the form is preview notification button
2:43:17
so once you are done with creation of notification you can preview it and see how
2:43:24
notification will be displayed to the user on the email let's see the notification
2:43:29
form and create a new notification you need to click on this new button
2:43:39
once you will click on this new button you will be able to see the new notification form
2:43:47
and you will see the fields which you were talking about
2:43:52
here provide a name for the notification which you are going
2:43:57
to create so i will give it a name as
2:44:03
notify on priority
2:44:13
changes to p1 we will select the table
2:44:19
and i will select incident table we are going to create this notification
2:44:25
for incident table i'm going to leave a category as it is
2:44:30
for now then i will go to first section that is when to send
2:44:37
now here we will select send when and i will keep this option ad as it is but
2:44:42
you can still see other options like event is fire triggered and i will just click on update it i
2:44:49
don't want to do it for inserted here i will put the condition now condition
2:44:56
you have to select the fields so here i will select
2:45:01
priority changes to
2:45:07
critical now this is when to send so this is the condition that when exactly the system
2:45:14
should send the notification then i will go to the next section that will say uh who will receive
2:45:21
here i will select a user so maybe i will expand it first i will open it and i will select a random user maybe this
2:45:28
one i will select a group
2:45:35
i will select maybe cab approvals this just for example just a demo
2:45:41
and i also have this user groups and fields now if you will expand this you will see
2:45:46
all the fields where basically you have the data related to user or a group
2:45:53
you will still see other fields but that is something you don't have to select so you can select maybe caller you can
2:45:59
select assignment group you can select assign to that is what you can select and close
2:46:04
this and just click on save you are done notification is created
2:46:13
is it no you still need to mention the body the content what exactly the content you
2:46:19
want to send while sending the while sending this notification
2:46:25
so you will go to the third section that is what it will contain
2:46:31
here you will see we have this email template and we also have method html that means your body
2:46:37
body of the email and then we have subject we will click on this advanced view
2:46:45
if you will click on this advanced view you will see the same fields which we were talking about
2:46:51
so now you see more fields in the same section i don't have to select any any other
2:46:58
field right now so i will just give here subject so priority pro
2:47:04
i will just mention the priority increased priority
2:47:11
change to p14 now here you have to put the incident
2:47:17
number and that should be dynamic you can't make it static so in that case servicenow gives you an
2:47:23
option here and here you can select the field value
2:47:28
so if you will select number it will be pasted here you have to just
2:47:35
copy or cut from here and then you can
2:47:40
paste here now as of now it's kind of a variable dollar number
2:47:47
now but when email will be sent it will automatically put the number of that particular
2:47:52
incident record so in that case i will put it again here in the body because i need it so i will
2:47:59
mention high
2:48:05
priority of
2:48:13
change to p1 that's it
2:48:19
i will save it now now you are done with the creation of this notification
2:48:25
you don't need to make any other settings unless you have some you want to add
2:48:30
some additional features so in that case you are done with your notification now we will test this
2:48:36
notification so for that i will go to incident management application
2:48:44
so here i have incident application and i will just try to open existing
2:48:50
incidents so we'll open the list of existing incident and wherever priority is low maybe accept critical
2:48:58
because that's what we want as part of the condition so maybe we will have this one
2:49:04
and i will just click here it is i think we just clicked on the
2:49:09
critical one we don't want critical we want accept critical so we will click on maybe this one
2:49:19
here it says planning it's very very low
2:49:25
as a use case i can tell you that this notification will be helpful that
2:49:30
if somebody changes the priority you want to send the notification to
2:49:36
important people to concerned stakeholders in that case you can add them in the recipients
2:49:42
so here if i changes to high and high now this will
2:49:48
automatically change the priority to critical as of now i don't have any assignment
2:49:53
group i will just select any one assignment group and maybe i will select
2:49:59
assign to as well and i will save this
2:50:06
i have to mention something in this mandatory field work node so before i save it i
2:50:12
have to put something here so i will just do test for now
2:50:19
and i will save this so priority is now changed to p1
2:50:24
it is saved in your database and you will see system will also send
2:50:30
the notification and if i reload it let's see if email is created
2:50:41
maybe i will show you in the logs in emails logs so we have this emails
2:50:48
and you can see we have this notification priority changes to p1 for this that's great that means you got the
2:50:55
notification so this email was sent and who are the recipients these are the
2:51:02
recipients you can see it was sent to cab approval fred ludy who was the caller and assignment group and assigned to as
2:51:09
well the person in assign2 so in that case if i open this you can
2:51:15
also see it in the email logs of incident record that is an activity
2:51:20
stream so here we have this priority this was another notification you can see we also have another notification
2:51:28
and here we have which we just created if you click on this button it will expand it and then you can see the body
2:51:34
of the email as well now what exactly you see in the body so you see the message which we just
2:51:40
pasted in our notification but you also see these two options what
2:51:46
are they now this one is basically for unsubscribe and notification preference
2:51:53
button so the users can directly route to their notification preference if they want to change anything
2:52:00
unsubscribe is something if they don't want to get this kind of notification they can click on unsubscribe and they
2:52:06
will not get this notification now at the very bottom you have this
2:52:12
reference number now this is alpha numeric code which i was talking about that's a random number
2:52:19
and that is referred as watermark
2:52:25
watermark of every email notification for a particular racket
2:52:31
now one of the important feature i can tell you for watermark is
2:52:36
so for example if somebody responds to this email address to this email which was sent to the user
2:52:45
how servicenow will know that this email has to be updated in
2:52:51
this particular record the service now will know about it with the help of this watermark
2:52:59
you can definitely update some conditions as part of the inbound actions which we will learn a little bit later
2:53:06
but this is really helpful so that system can recognize that which particular record i have to update this
2:53:13
notification email script you can also add custom scripts in your
2:53:20
notifications to make the content of notification more dynamic
2:53:25
this is the module which is showing the list of email scripts used in different notifications and these are all out of
2:53:32
the box email scripts once email script is created
2:53:37
you can mention them in the message body and content will be sent as per the data
2:53:43
pulled from mail script or whatever code you have written that is how your notification will be
2:53:49
sent the syntax of adding email script in the message body is
2:53:56
dollar and you start with curly braces mail underscore script that is something
2:54:02
you have to mention then equal to and then you have to provide name of your email script you
2:54:09
created inbound email action
2:54:14
service now can create or update records as per the email received from external
2:54:19
users to servicenow email address of the instance
2:54:25
this is the module of inbound action under system policy
2:54:30
servicenow admins can configure inbound action for different tables to create or
2:54:35
update records of those tables when email is received
2:54:41
let me show you the form of inbound action and its fields
2:54:50
name you can provide the name of your inbound action in this field
2:54:55
then we have target table you need to select the table for which inbound action is needed like incident
2:55:02
table change table problem table then you have action type
2:55:08
here you have to select the type of action needed when email is received and condition is matched
2:55:15
you can select to perform some action or to return with the response from service now that means
2:55:22
once email is received you can select the type whether you want to do some action you want to take some action once
2:55:28
email is received or you want to just respond back to the user on the same email once email is received
2:55:36
then you have stop processing if no other inbound action should run
2:55:42
after processing of current inbound action then you can select this check box
2:55:48
inbound action also depends on two sections the first section we have is when to run
2:55:56
where you need to put the condition and configure when inbound action can trigger the condition
2:56:02
and the second tab is actions where you can mention that action what
2:56:07
action is needed once condition is matched however this can be done via scripting
2:56:14
and you can see a script field so let's see fields of these two
2:56:19
sections in the first section we have type
2:56:25
so as you know we have three types of emails new email reply email and forward
2:56:30
email we can trigger the inbound action on the basis of this type of
2:56:36
option then you have required roles generally anyone can send email and you
2:56:43
can trigger inbound actions however if you want sender emails should have a
2:56:48
specific role to trigger inbound action you are going to create that is something you can mention here
2:56:56
execution order you might have multiple inbound actions on same table
2:57:02
system will prioritize the processing of inbound action as per the execution order
2:57:08
lowest number will be processed first
2:57:14
from you can also select the user to trigger this inbound action
2:57:19
and then we have conditions in this field you need to mention the conditions of email elements and some
2:57:27
system fields in another tab that is action you can
2:57:32
define the action to be performed when condition will be met so you can see the field called script
2:57:39
and here you can mention what kind of action you want to take once condition is matched
2:57:46
whatever you have mentioned in when to run inbound action is found under system
2:57:52
policy so if you will type in application navigator inbound actions under system
2:57:59
policy under email section you will find inbound actions if you click on that you
2:58:05
will see the list of inbound actions the list of inbound actions you have in
2:58:10
your instance and if you click this new button you will be able to create new inbound
2:58:17
action here we have options you can see new reply forward
2:58:23
action type you can also see the conditions now in conditions these are not some kind of
2:58:30
tables in your system these are the conditions for
2:58:35
elements you have your these are the conditions for the
2:58:41
elements you have in your email like it will search for some keywords
2:58:47
it will look for bcc blind copied it look for body so you can mention that condition body text
2:58:54
checkpoint content type copied created when exactly it was to that is something you can see
2:59:01
headers as well importance whether there is if you you have any kind of importance in the email
2:59:07
mailbox notification type receive type that is something you can mention and then that's how system will take the
2:59:15
action now these fields which i'm showing you right now
2:59:21
these are the fields of your email table
2:59:27
if i go here and type emails
2:59:35
so these are the fields which we are talking about so if i click table
2:59:43
you will see all those fields so anyhow that condition you have to
2:59:49
mention as part of this table but mostly the elements are from the message
2:59:56
that means from the email so this is how you can configure inbound actions in service now
3:00:04
knowledge management in this section we will learn knowledge
3:00:09
management in servicenow benefits of knowledge management
3:00:14
knowledge articles creation process knowledge feedback import of knowledge articles in
3:00:21
servicenow knowledge article
3:00:27
a knowledge article is a record in knowledge base that provides information to users
3:00:34
a knowledge article can be a policy self-help tips troubleshooting document or resolution
3:00:42
steps document benefits of knowledge management
3:00:49
knowledge management is a practice to manage knowledge articles with defined
3:00:54
process in the organization it has a lot of benefits
3:01:00
like it is a one-stop solution for users to find the answers and get quick help via
3:01:08
self-service it provides a centralized location for
3:01:14
the creation categorization and viewing of the articles
3:01:21
the information and articles are stored in a knowledge base
3:01:26
that means it is kind of a bucket which is being categorized as per the
3:01:32
process you have as per the business units you have in your organization
3:01:38
articles in service now are referred as kb articles
3:01:45
knowledge application in order to manage knowledge management
3:01:52
and its process servicenow has out of the box knowledge
3:01:57
management application users with right roles can access this application
3:02:03
and the modules under this application they can create and maintain knowledge
3:02:10
articles in this application in order to go to knowledge application
3:02:17
you need to type knowledge in application navigator
3:02:22
when you will type knowledge you will find this application
3:02:28
so this is knowledge management application and you can see various modules under
3:02:34
this application and as i mentioned users with required roles for knowledge
3:02:40
management can access these modules the first module we have is home page
3:02:50
which shows the knowledge page where users can search for different articles of the instance to get some
3:02:56
help you will see different knowledge bases which you can create as per your
3:03:03
company's process knowledge bases can be created on the basis of departments
3:03:10
business units etc now this page will be different for each
3:03:15
user as per the access they have for knowledge bases
3:03:21
users might see all the knowledge bases and their articles or they can only see
3:03:27
one or two knowledge bases and their articles as per the access they have
3:03:35
if i click one of the knowledge base then you will see the list of articles
3:03:41
under that knowledge base now on this page at the very top you
3:03:48
have this search box in which you can search for the articles
3:03:54
so if users comes on this page they can search for different articles they want
3:03:59
some kind of help so let me type linux in this particular
3:04:05
search box and if i press enter i will see the results and i will see
3:04:11
the articles related to the linux word so wherever this search will find that
3:04:18
linux keyword it will try to populate those articles in this particular view
3:04:25
now we can also perform this searching all the knowledge bases we have and we have access to
3:04:31
or you can also select the knowledge bases from here as well
3:04:37
so if you want to search any particular article for a particular knowledge base in that case you can select it and then
3:04:44
you can search accordingly and if you want to search all you can just select all as well
3:04:52
at the right top you have these two buttons one is create an article
3:04:58
another one is post a question create an article is basically used to
3:05:05
create new article however this button will be visible to
3:05:10
the users who have create access that means who have access to create new
3:05:16
articles and then we have another button where it says post a question which is
3:05:22
used to post questions and others users can provide the answers
3:05:28
let me open this article
3:05:33
now this is end user view of any article and this is the main content
3:05:41
of knowledge article next module we have in a section
3:05:48
that is articles which shows list of articles with
3:05:53
different stages the first module is create new this
3:06:00
module opens up some new knowledge form to create a knowledge article
3:06:06
users who have write access create access they can provide the data
3:06:11
and they can create knowledge articles with the help of this form
3:06:18
then we have import articles this module gives you a feature to
3:06:23
import external files in doc or docx format
3:06:29
so you can browse the files and you can import that article into service now knowledge management
3:06:36
you can select the knowledge base here in which knowledge base you want to insert that article and then you can
3:06:42
browse the file you can you have to select that knowledge document from your system and it can be imported in service
3:06:50
now you can also select the category of that particular article
3:06:56
then we have unpublished which shows the list of articles which are not yet
3:07:03
not yet published then we have retired
3:07:10
then we have published as well and then we have all
3:07:16
which shows all the articles regardless of their stage
3:07:21
even they are published even they are unpublished or retired all the articles
3:07:27
of your instance the next module we have is related to
3:07:33
submissions submissions are kind of request to
3:07:39
create articles which can be requested by users who don't have access to create
3:07:45
articles these submissions are reviewed by different assignment groups
3:07:52
and users who have access can create articles on the basis of data provided
3:07:58
in submission so this module shows the list of submission records
3:08:04
which are still open to take some action another feature of service now is
3:08:11
knowledge management feedback users who are using and viewing the
3:08:16
articles can provide the feedback as well so that owners of articles can
3:08:22
improve the content or quality of the knowledge article
3:08:27
let me open an article by going to the home page i will go to home page
3:08:36
i will open this knowledge base and i will click on this article
3:08:44
now the first feedback can be given by selecting stars
3:08:50
which are basically you can provide the rating for this article and you have one to five stars
3:08:57
and you can rate this article so users who are viewing this article or
3:09:03
who will be viewing this article they can rate the article
3:09:08
at the right top you have this button flag article
3:09:13
so if you want to flag this article you can click this button and you have to provide a reason that
3:09:19
why exactly you are flagging this article
3:09:25
i can cancel this now we also have a feedback to be given
3:09:31
if article is helpful or it is not
3:09:36
in that case if you go a little bit bottom you will see here this section helpful question mark yes or no
3:09:45
and then at the very bottom you will find the user can also provide the comment
3:09:51
for the article he is viewing so you can put something here like test
3:09:57
and maybe just click on comment and you can also make it yes helper you
3:10:03
can just click on yes and that will also be captured
3:10:08
so servicenow also has out of the box module section to manage
3:10:14
these feedbacks all these ratings all these feedbacks
3:10:19
are basically captured and tracked in a table of rackets and that is shown under knowledge
3:10:26
application of servicenow and that section is basically called
3:10:32
feedback management which is also under knowledge application
3:10:38
and the first module we have is feedback
3:10:43
which shows the list of all types of feedback submitted by users be it rating
3:10:48
beat comment or helpful or not
3:10:54
then i have my flag which shows the list of knowledge articles which have been
3:10:59
flagged by logged in user in this case it will show articles flagged by myself
3:11:08
we have all flagged which shows the list of all flagged articles of the instance
3:11:14
then we have some modules related to tasks which basically gets created when
3:11:20
articles are marked not helpful or flagged
3:11:25
users who have access they can take some action on these tasks
3:11:30
to improve the quality of knowledge articles then we have administration section
3:11:38
in which you can perform more configuration of knowledge management
3:11:44
and the first module we have is guided setup this module provides step-by-step
3:11:51
guidance to implement knowledge management in your organization
3:11:56
or whenever you are implementing for any customer you can utilize this particular module
3:12:02
and that's a feature of servicenow guided setup for different applications
3:12:08
then you have knowledge bases this shows the list of knowledge bases created in your instance
3:12:17
you can create knowledge bases for different departments as well now let's see this knowledge base
3:12:30
you have important fields like owner managers who will be the knowledge
3:12:36
managers you have workflow for publishing and retiring as well so if you want to
3:12:42
retire the articles what workflow you want to follow that is something you can select and while publishing it what
3:12:48
workflow you want to follow you can select that as well
3:12:53
at the bottom you have some related list which shows the list of articles in this
3:12:59
knowledge base this one and then you have can read and can
3:13:06
contribute where you can define the criteria to provide read and write access to the
3:13:12
users so what users can read the basically articles
3:13:19
and what users can contribute what users can create it what users can edit the articles that is something you can
3:13:25
mention in this particular section now why service now has given this as a
3:13:30
criteria so in this case you don't have to select the users directly you can just mention
3:13:37
the criteria and utilize it beat location
3:13:42
if i click here you will see you can select individual users groups roles
3:13:48
locations companies departments and all then we have ratings module
3:13:55
which shows list of ratings submitted by the users
3:14:00
now this module shows same records from the feedback table however it is just
3:14:06
the rating view and fields which are visible here they
3:14:11
are related to rating then we have search log
3:14:17
which shows the list of keywords entered by users while searching for knowledge
3:14:23
articles then we have navigation add-ons
3:14:30
this is just for additional search on google or microsoft
3:14:35
or oracle as well then we have messages
3:14:42
this module shows dynamic method for different elements and this is not just related to
3:14:48
knowledge management this is for whole platform and can be used in different
3:14:53
applications then we have properties
3:14:58
in this module you will see properties related to knowledge management and can configure as per your requirement and
3:15:05
process then we have overview
3:15:10
which shows the dashboard for the data of knowledge articles
3:15:18
so it gives an overview for your knowledge management in service now
3:15:24
then we have user criteria which we were talking about so you can create different user criteria and select them
3:15:30
in in different knowledge bases you will create
3:15:35
so as i mentioned earlier that users with valid role can access knowledge management application
3:15:42
however knowledge articles can be visible to users as per the access they have
3:15:48
which is on the basis of user criteria selected in the knowledge base
3:15:54
and the last module we have is user criteria diagnostics
3:16:00
in this module you will just check that what kind of access control what kind of criteria is applied on an article
3:16:08
or knowledge base for a user you can select the user you can select
3:16:14
which type of diagnostic you have to run and then you can also select the article
3:16:20
so if i select any user maybe system administrator
3:16:28
and if i select any article maybe this one
3:16:34
and i click on diagnose so it says read and contribute access that means
3:16:40
this user has contribute access read access and contribute access and it is a great
3:16:47
functionality guys so if you are an admin and if somebody is raising a concern
3:16:53
that they don't have access maybe or they had access and now they're not able to create it maybe they're not able to
3:16:59
read the articles in that case at least you can diagnose it that what kind of
3:17:04
access that user has so i would say it is pretty much great functionality provided by servicenow
3:17:14
knowledge portal servicenow also has out of the box knowledge portal
3:17:21
which is kind of advanced view of knowledge home page and it is accessed via portal
3:17:29
now features are quite similar like we can do searching on this page you can view the article with some different
3:17:35
categories but it is just an advanced view in order to go to this advanced
3:17:42
portal i need to go to in the url
3:17:49
i will remove and i will just add here after our
3:17:54
domain i will just add sp and press enter
3:18:01
when you will do that it will open the portal page so this is the main portal page of your
3:18:07
servicenow instance now users can go to knowledge portal by
3:18:13
two options one is here that is at the top and then we have here
3:18:19
in the middle knowledge base if you click on knowledge
3:18:26
you will see knowledge portal so you can search
3:18:31
here and this is the search box which is at the top in the left you will see the categories
3:18:37
of the articles and if i click in one of the category
3:18:45
i will be able to see the list of articles related to this category
3:18:52
you can click any article and this view is end user view
3:19:01
and here as well you can read this article you can provide comments you can also mention helpful yes or no and you
3:19:09
can provide comments as well so as i mentioned functionality features are pretty much
3:19:16
similar however it is just an advanced ui so and and user friendly
3:19:26
servicenow developers and administrators can customize this knowledge portal as
3:19:32
well so if you have your customer requirement maybe they don't want some icons maybe
3:19:38
they want to change the design of your portal maybe for knowledge portal separately in that case you can do that
3:19:45
as well so servicenow developers and administrators can do that
3:19:51
knowledge form you can create new articles
3:19:56
so let's see different fields and options we have on knowledge form
3:20:02
we have number which shows the number for every article
3:20:07
and it gets automatically generated for every new article
3:20:14
we have knowledge base users can select the knowledge base for which article needs to be created
3:20:23
then we have category here you select what category of article users wants to create
3:20:31
we have valid 2 in this field you can select till when article is valid
3:20:37
after valid to date article will be retired automatically
3:20:44
then we have short description in this field you need to provide brief detail of the article
3:20:52
then we have article type in this field you select the type of article and you have options like
3:20:59
html or wiki then we have workflow this field shows
3:21:05
stages of article which starts with draft so draft is the first stage when you
3:21:12
create the article and that's what it shows in this particular field
3:21:19
source task this field shows the task from which this article is created
3:21:28
attachment link if you want article as an attachment
3:21:34
that means you don't want people to see the content of this article and they can just click on the link of the article
3:21:42
knowledge article and document should be able to download it in that case you can check this box that
3:21:48
means attach some document and check this box
3:21:54
then you have display attachments you can check this box if you have or if
3:22:00
you then we have display attachments
3:22:05
you can check this box if you want attachments to be displayed on article main page
3:22:11
so when users see the article view the article in that case whatever attachments you have if
3:22:17
you want to show them you can also do that that will be shown at the bottom of the
3:22:22
page and here is the main component that is article body
3:22:30
this is the main field which will be showing the main content of your article to the users
3:22:40
then we have submit button which will create the article and we also have one more button that is
3:22:46
used to search for duplicates so if you will type anything in short description and you will click on search it will try
3:22:53
to search the same keyword in our knowledge bases and all the knowledge bases we have and see if you have
3:23:00
similar kind of articles it's just kind of a help that before creating an article you should just take a look
3:23:06
whether you have similar kind of article in the system let's create a new article
3:23:14
i will go to knowledge application
3:23:21
i will click on create new which is under articles section i will click on create new
3:23:30
you can see number is auto populated and it is also showing you incremental
3:23:36
numbers so every time i will click on create new it will keep on adding numbers new
3:23:41
numbers then you can see here knowledge base is mandatory so i need to select one of the
3:23:48
knowledge base existing knowledge base i will select i t
3:23:53
now once you will select knowledge base you can also select category
3:23:59
so if i click here i would be able to select category for this new article
3:24:07
so i will select android i'm not touching valid2 right now
3:24:13
article type html attachment link display attachments and here i'm just doing
3:24:21
android demo article
3:24:27
testing and i will just copy this and just
3:24:33
paste here and i will click on save
3:24:42
so you can see i have given short description an article body and article is created
3:24:50
so you have just clicked on save button an article is created with these information which i have given right now now how can you see that end user view
3:24:58
you can see that end user view by clicking this button at the bottom that is view article
3:25:04
so if you will click this button you will be able to see that article
3:25:09
you can see the stars you can see the body as well here and
3:25:14
the short description which you just created so that's how you can create new article
3:25:24
let me also show you the roles associated with knowledge management application
3:25:31
so if i go to roles mod module so we have a module roles
3:25:38
under user administration you will find roles as well click on roles
3:25:45
in name you can search for knowledge because most of the roles
3:25:51
they have knowledge word so if i press enter you will see these major roles we have
3:25:59
knowledge role now this role basically if if user will have this role
3:26:04
he can write edit and review knowledge management articles if user has knowledge admin role then
3:26:11
they can manage knowledge knowledge bases and if user has knowledge manager
3:26:18
they can administer knowledge bases and request new knowledge bases for knowledge management
3:26:24
to a knowledge admin to approve and then we have one more for role
3:26:30
managing updating deleting the information on security incident knowledge bases this is something
3:26:35
different this is not specific to our knowledge application that is this is something related to the
3:26:42
security application we have in service now and whatever knowledge management associated with it you have this
3:26:49
particular role just to manage knowledge management for that security application
3:26:56
knowledge management workflow an article cannot just be allowed to
3:27:01
create without any review to make sure proper process has been
3:27:07
followed so when you create an article it follows a workflow
3:27:13
in which it goes from different stages and finally gets published
3:27:19
or maybe retired so when article is created
3:27:24
it goes to draft stage the author who has created this article
3:27:31
he can push for the next stage by clicking publish button
3:27:37
and then that article will be sent for approval
3:27:43
now that approval basically goes to knowledge base managers
3:27:49
owner or it can write it can route it to different approvers as per the workflow
3:27:56
created in different organizations that means you can customize this workflow
3:28:03
so out of the box it goes to knowledge base manager or if you want to customize it you can definitely do that
3:28:14
so once article is approved it is published
3:28:19
and users can view the article there can also be a situation
3:28:27
when authors want to retire the articles
3:28:33
in that case author can request for retiring the article
3:28:39
then it goes for approval to retire the article
3:28:44
and once approved article is retired
3:28:49
and in this case users can no more view the article
3:28:54
so overall users can view published articles and that makes sense you don't
3:29:00
want users to view the article which is not even ready yet so in that case as for the process as
3:29:07
with the system we just need to make sure that users are able to see only
3:29:12
published articles when i when i say users those are end users who really have to use those
3:29:18
articles but if if you are part of knowledge management team and you have access to knowledge management
3:29:25
application in that case you won't need to worry about it and you will be able
3:29:31
to see all the articles regardless of their stage
3:29:37
let me show you the workflow for knowledge management i will go to workflow module of service now
3:29:48
here we have this workflow editor if you will click this button
3:29:54
it will open the workflow and all the workflow existed in your instance
3:30:01
so these are the list of workflows we have you can see we do have a lot of workflows for knowledge management as
3:30:07
well you can see the table knowledge i can select this and just do show
3:30:12
matching so these are four workflows which are created out of the box
3:30:20
so you can add them in your different knowledge bases as per the requirement you have as for the process you want to
3:30:27
follow for your knowledge base
3:30:34
and if i open one of them for example this one
3:30:46
you can see the workflow starts from here from draft stage it goes for approval it creates event
3:30:54
it will publish the article it gets end it's pretty much simple and
3:30:59
straightforward but if you have custom requirement from your
3:31:05
customers or clients in that case you can also edit these workflows or maybe you can create your
3:31:13
own workflow from scratch and then you can just utilize them
3:31:18
import articles you can also import articles in service
3:31:23
now servicenow provides a functionality to import articles from word documents
3:31:33
that means if you have bunch of word documents which basically your users used to refer
3:31:40
and you if you want to import them in service now as a knowledge article you can also do that
3:31:48
let's take a look so here i have a word document
3:31:54
so i will just quickly create this article so maybe i will just type something test
3:32:02
for article
3:32:07
import and then i will save this
3:32:14
i'm saving it as test article import and i will click on and this is docx
3:32:21
format the format which we need to import the article in service now i will click on save
3:32:28
so this article is saved i will close this i will go back to my instance so here is
3:32:35
my instance and i will go to my application knowledge
3:32:42
here i have this module import articles
3:32:48
i will select the knowledge base maybe in it i will select a category as well maybe
3:32:53
microsoft and i will click on browse files
3:32:59
and i will select that article that doc so here we have this test for
3:33:04
article import i will select this it is uploaded
3:33:10
and now i can click on import now the important part here is you can import
3:33:16
multiple documents multiple articles you can import in one time as well
3:33:21
so you just need to click on import here if you click on import
3:33:27
your you can see import is done so upload is completed and now you can click on continue
3:33:34
an article is created you can see we have this article created and short
3:33:40
description was take basically taken from the name of the file and let's see the content so if i click here
3:33:48
see we have this test for article import so it took the short description as well
3:33:55
and it took this content as well whatever i mentioned in the word document body
3:34:02
and if i click on add it you will be able to see the native view of this article see we have this
3:34:10
name here we have this short description here now we have this attachment link
3:34:17
what i will do i will just click on this attachment link i will attach an article
3:34:25
or just any document i want to attach let's attach the same one which we just created
3:34:31
i have attached it and i will just close this now and i will
3:34:37
save this let's say i will publish it as well you
3:34:45
can see i have clicked on publish and it says article is in review so i
3:34:51
will go back again edit i have this approval because as of now
3:34:57
i have admin access so i can approve it i will approve it
3:35:03
because i have admin access it is approved and you can see the workflow stage here
3:35:10
we have published so article is now published and we have this attachment attached now
3:35:16
what is the difference if i have this attachment link here so if i go let's search for this article
3:35:24
so i will copy this i will go to my home page
3:35:33
and try to search for it i will press enter
3:35:38
so here i have that article let's see what happens if i click this
3:35:45
you will see that it did not open the content of the article
3:35:50
it just downloaded the attachment i had in this article
3:35:56
so that's a difference if you will check that box that attachment in that case it
3:36:01
will only download all the attachments of in in that particular article
3:36:07
and if you uncheck it then you can view the article as well
3:36:13
so this is how you can import the articles in service now and utilize the
3:36:18
power of knowledge management in service now so let's start with knowledge check two
3:36:26
of the service now system administrator training
3:36:32
the first question we have is name two tables extended from task table your
3:36:38
time starts now
3:36:49
and the answer is incident and change there can be other tables as well like
3:36:55

3:39:39
your time starts now
3:39:51
by using user criteria question number nine
3:39:58
how users can raise requests to get knowledge articles created if they don't
3:40:03
have access to create articles directly in knowledge management your time starts now
3:40:19
and the answer is submission request question number 10
3:40:26
which field provide information about task from which article is created or
3:40:32
related to your time starts now
3:40:45
and the answer is source task field on knowledge form
3:40:51
service catalog in this section we will learn about service catalog and its benefits
3:40:58
catalog items and categories service now catalog workflow
3:41:05
service catalog tasks and we will also try to create some catalog items in this session
3:41:17
what is service catalog service catalog is a request ordering
3:41:23
system to request services and products offered by different departments of any
3:41:29
organization example hosting team provide cloud computing services where users can
3:41:36
request for cloud servers windows team provide a service for
3:41:42
password reset where users can themselves can reset a password for example windows password
3:41:50
so these are the services which you can host which you can put on service catalog and different users can request
3:41:57
for those items services and products and that is what service catalog is
3:42:05
benefits of service catalog service catalog is like amazon website
3:42:13
where you see different items in different categories it has many benefits like
3:42:21
it is one stop shop to request different services provided by all the departments
3:42:27
of organization all the services and products can be
3:42:32
displayed into different categories which helps users to find the right services
3:42:40
organizations can implement multiple catalogues in service now
3:42:46
overall service catalog gives you same experience like you do shopping on
3:42:51
amazon where you see different products from different sellers and you can add them
3:42:56
in a cart and request multiple products together and the important part is you can also
3:43:03
track them and when exactly you're going to get them you can see that data as well
3:43:09
users can see service catalog under self-service application
3:43:15
as you know self-service is an application which is visible to all the users of the platform even they
3:43:22
don't have roles so here we have the self-service
3:43:27
application and under the self-service application you can see this module called service
3:43:33
catalog if users will click this module they will be able to see service catalog
3:43:41
where you can see different categories and different services provided by
3:43:47
different departments like i can order any hardware from here
3:43:54
you can see i can order a laptop i can order a phone if i go back
3:44:00
i have software service as well it's a category where i have different items
3:44:06
for different softwares i can install those softwares in my computer
3:44:12
but before that i have to request for them and we have some other categories as
3:44:17
well like can we help you some office services peripherals now these are the
3:44:22
categories under these categories you have different services which you can order which users can order now this is
3:44:30
my personal developer instance so this is just a demo data but if you are implementing service
3:44:35
catalog in your organization so this is how users can see the service catalog
3:44:41
and request for different services
3:44:46
service catalog application in order to manage different products and services
3:44:53
service now has service catalog application where users with catalog roles can
3:44:59
create edit and manage services and products they can do different configurations for
3:45:06
different services which are basically provided by different departments and which are basically
3:45:12
visible on service catalog or maybe which you want them to be visible on service catalog
3:45:19
in that case you can utilize this application to configure different catalog items and categories
3:45:27
you can go to service catalog application by typing service
3:45:33
catalog in application navigator if you will type that
3:45:38
you will find this application service catalog which we are talking about
3:45:43
and you can see various modules under this application
3:45:49
users with right roles they can access these applications and modules at
3:45:54
the same time they can also perform different configurations they can create different services they
3:46:00
can create different products to post on service catalog to publish on service
3:46:06
catalog if i just talk about high level the different modules we have under this
3:46:12
application the first application we have is catalogs so as i mentioned you can create different catalogs in service
3:46:20
catalog for example we have this service catalog we also have technical catalog
3:46:26
then we have catalog now this is just a default catalog which you want to provide to the end users
3:46:32
that is something you can see here so just a single catalog here you have different services you can add different
3:46:38
items as well here then we have open records we will learn a little bit later about
3:46:45
what kind of task what kind of rackets are created by service catalog
3:46:50
so when users request for any item when the user submit any form
3:46:56
what kind of records are created that is something you will see later however those records are basically you can see
3:47:03
those records in this module that is open records you can see all the requests you can see all the items
3:47:09
request then you can see tasks as well then we have catalog definitions which
3:47:16
is a section of modules where you can define different items different services which you want to publish on
3:47:22
service catalog so we also have my catalogs so where
3:47:28
catalog is created by me that is something you can see here we have my categories as i mentioned before users
3:47:35
see different items basically they see different categories so that it will be easy for them to find
3:47:42
the right service for them for example hardware software different
3:47:47
services those are the high level categories which are useful so the users can find
3:47:53
the right service for them and just request for it then we have my items now these are the
3:48:00
items as of now it is just showing my item that means items which i have created
3:48:06
then i have maintained catalogs now here i can maintain the catalogs it is showing me all the catalogs created in
3:48:13
my instance then i have maintained categories that means all the categories created in my
3:48:18
instance i can also create new category if i just go one of the category maybe
3:48:23
just click on services this is the category then i have
3:48:29
renderers then i have maintained dynamic categories i can also maintain dynamic
3:48:34
categories dynamic when i say dynamic that means you can see here top request
3:48:40
that means most commonly requested items the items which users request commonly
3:48:49
then we have my content items there is something related to the document the content item which you want to display
3:48:55
on your service catalog and then we have some other modules as
3:49:00
well to configure this service catalog to configure different items we have and to do different kind of configurations
3:49:08
service catalog categories services and products of service catalog
3:49:15
are divided into logical groups which are called categories
3:49:20
as an example you have software office supplies desktops peripherals
3:49:26
now these are the categories as i mentioned these are out of the box categories just as a demo data
3:49:32
but in your organization it's up to you it's up to your business requirement that what kind of categories you want to
3:49:39
create as i showed you you can see the categories in service
3:49:44
catalog application and you can manage those categories so if you will go to this module called
3:49:51
maintain categories if you will click on that you will be able to see all the categories of your instance
3:49:58
and if you want to create new you can also do that if i go one of the category like software
3:50:05
you can see that in which catalog i want to create this category you can select here
3:50:10
you can also have parent and child relationship between different categories
3:50:16
and here we have all the items under this category which are basically displayed so when user clicks on
3:50:23
software category then they can see all these items created under this category
3:50:30
and you have here one more option categories as i mentioned you can have parent and child relationship between
3:50:37
the categories so if you want to create any any child category or maybe parent
3:50:43
categories in parent you can have to mention here if you want to create child for this category you can create here
3:50:49
so that's how you manage categories in service catalog service catalog catalog items
3:50:58
catalog items are the services and products offered by different departments of the organization
3:51:06
catalog items are basically forms which users submit to raise any request
3:51:12
and these catalog items create tasks to different themes
3:51:17
as you can see we have this developer laptop now it is an item
3:51:22
provided by one of the department and that would be for sure it department
3:51:28
so as an employee if you want to request for any new laptop you don't have to reach out to any
3:51:34
different teams via emails or chat or phone you just need to go to service catalog
3:51:40
see the service go to hardware check this laptop if you're a developer then
3:51:45
it's request for this service and that is what catalog item
3:51:53
which is kind of a service a product where users which users can request
3:51:58
and get the service and once users request for it it goes to
3:52:04
the different process different workflow and it gets assigned to different departments who have to work to complete
3:52:11
those requests that particular service and once everything is done then that
3:52:16
request is completed for the user similar like categories
3:52:22
you can also manage these catalog items so if you will go to service
3:52:27
catalog and you have this module called maintain items if you will click on that
3:52:33
now these are all item services products which are provided by different departments
3:52:41
if i click any one of them like access you know microsoft access
3:52:46
that is something you want to install or a user wants to install in his computer
3:52:53
now these are the details you can provide the details like price you can list price as well how much cost
3:53:00
this particular service is that is something you can provide delivery time and lot of other details you can mention
3:53:07
here which vendor product it is that is something you can mention here as well
3:53:13
what is the catalog that which catalog you want to display this particular item you can select it from here
3:53:19
which category this particular item has to be added so in software that is what
3:53:25
you can do so it is a catalog item if i go back and open any other catalog item maybe like a
3:53:33
hardware device maybe new email account so this is kind of a service which is provided by exchange
3:53:39
team your email team who who have provided this service so
3:53:44
that new users can create new email accounts so if i have to create a new
3:53:49
email account this is the service i will use as an end user but as of now you can see
3:53:56
it is just a racket because this is a backend racket where you can configure and then users
3:54:03
can just request for this but how they will request it now that is something
3:54:08
form now servicenow gives you a really great functionality to check how end user will
3:54:13
see this particular item once it is created so you have this button called try it if
3:54:20
i click this you can see i can mention preferred email address and i can order it
3:54:28
so that is what catalog item so catalog item is just kind of a form which users
3:54:34
can request so overall it's a service it's a product provided by different departments
3:54:42
service catalog roles service catalog in service now has four
3:54:48
major roles to manage it the first role we have is admin that we
3:54:54
know which is assigned to system administrator who has access to most of the
3:54:59
applications and modules and can configure any application in service now similarly admin role user can also
3:55:07
configure service catalog he can create catalog items he can
3:55:12
manage it he can edit it them as well then we have catalog admin
3:55:19
he is catalog administrator now this user can manage service catalog
3:55:25
application which includes catalogs categories and items but not including scripting
3:55:32
functions that means catalog admin cannot do scripting
3:55:37
which is basically done by servicenow administrators who has admin role
3:55:43
then we have catalog manager who can edit and update a service catalog as well
3:55:49
categories and catalog items within that catalog
3:55:55
now catalog manager can assign editors as well
3:56:00
and they can also assign different managers for that service catalog
3:56:08
and the last role we have is catalog editor who can edit and update a service
3:56:15
catalog and they can also edit categories and catalog items within that catalog
3:56:23
now catalog editors can assign other editors but they cannot change catalog manager
3:56:30
while catalog manager can add a catalog manager but catalog editor cannot do
3:56:35
that so these are the different roles to manage to configure service catalog and
3:56:41
service now let me show you these roles in service now so if i go to
3:56:47
roles module so here i have under user administration
3:56:52
i have roles module and if i just search for catalog
3:56:58
you will see different roles and we do have other roles as well but the major role we have is catalog then
3:57:06
we have catalog admin catalog editor catalog manager
3:57:12
these are three major roles but you also have other roles for different access
3:57:19
and you can assign these roles to different users as per the requirement you have from your customer
3:57:27
service catalog components service catalog has three major
3:57:32
components the first one is order which is a service or product requested
3:57:39
by the user then we have order form which is submitted by the user after
3:57:46
filling up the form and then we have ordering process which works when request is created
3:57:56
so let me talk about the first component that is order
3:58:02
overall users can order three different items in servicenow service catalog
3:58:09
the first one is catalog item which can be a product or service like
3:58:15
laptop any software or hosting a server
3:58:21
then we have order guide in which multiple catalog items are
3:58:27
grouped in one request now order guide basically assist users
3:58:32
to order multiple items like new onboarding
3:58:38
in which user might need laptop mobile some of the softwares together during
3:58:44
onboarding of the employee so that is order guide
3:58:51
which is a package of multiple catalog items
3:58:57
then we have racket producer racket producer basically creates
3:59:02
records in existing table like incident table
3:59:07
change table problem table that means if you want to create a form
3:59:14
with few inputs few fields and after providing the input you want
3:59:19
to create some existing records like incident change problem in that case you can create racket producer in-service
3:59:26
now and anything which is apart from record producer like you want to uh host any
3:59:33
new service you want to provide any new offering that is something you can create catalog item
3:59:45
then we have order form in order form we have two components
3:59:52
that means i'm talking about now the form which users see and they provide inputs and submitted
4:00:00
so the two components we have on order form are variables
4:00:05
and variable sets variables are the questions of fields to
4:00:12
be filled by users on the form so whatever fields you see on the form those are called variables
4:00:20
users with right access they can create these variables as per the business requirement for a particular catalog
4:00:27
item then we have variable sets
4:00:32
variable set is a collection of variables basically if you have multiple variables
4:00:40
in one bucket that is called variable sets variable sets are created when multiple
4:00:46
variables are needed to be placed on multiple forms and i will give you an example
4:00:54
for on every form you might need requested for
4:00:59
or on behalf of these are two major fields which you normally want people to provide that
4:01:05
data to provide that input in that case
4:01:10
these fields are repeatable fields so when you will create these variables you have to create these variables in a
4:01:17
variable set rather than individual variables so that you can utilize these variable sets in
4:01:23
all the forms all the catalog items which you want to create in the future
4:01:33
then we have ordering process which is basically a backend logic to
4:01:39
process any request this logic can be designed with two
4:01:44
ways first one is workflow and then we have flows
4:01:51
workflow in which admins can create different activities like approvals
4:01:56
assignment custom logic with scripting to process any request
4:02:02
once users submit the form and basically it runs in the background
4:02:09
then we have flows flows is something servicenow came up i think recently not i think maybe two
4:02:16
or three versions before in which they came up with a logic uh with functionality in which users can
4:02:24
utilize workflows without any in scripting
4:02:29
like in workflow you you have if you have some complex condition you have to do some scripting however in flows even
4:02:36
if you have some kind of little bit less complex scripting or logic you don't have to script that
4:02:43
you can do that with the help of designer that is drag and drop that's it
4:02:48
so overall it is an easy way to create any automated flow for any request
4:02:55
flow is basically design in flow designer that's a functionality of service now
4:03:00
and the goal can be achieved without scripting let me show you these components in my
4:03:07
personal developer instance i will go to service catalog application
4:03:18
here i have the service catalog application first i will show you catalog item
4:03:25
which is part of order so i will go to maintain items
4:03:31
which shows the list of all catalog items all cut at all catalog items of
4:03:36
your instance so let me open any one catalog item
4:03:41
maybe sample item i think this is just a sample item created by servicenow
4:03:50
as of now it is not active so i will make it active just to show you how exactly it looks
4:03:57
like so i have these fields like name you can select the catalog you have category
4:04:05
and you have some other options as well here you can select the workflows if you
4:04:10
want to follow the flow for this this particular catalog item that is something you can select if you want to
4:04:16
select the workflow you can do that you also have execution plan that is something provided it's it's it helps
4:04:23
with the help of configuration that is what you can do as well so you can process your request with three things
4:04:29
basically flow workflow and execution plan then you have some design like picture
4:04:34
you want to add some icons or pictures that is something you can do you can provide some pricing as well here
4:04:41
and then we have some portal settings so if this item will be visible on portal what configurations you want that is
4:04:48
something you can mention here as well and these are all item details like
4:04:53
description if i go little bit bottom now here i have related list
4:04:58
now what kind of related list if you remember the component we talked about like variables so these are the fields which
4:05:05
a person who has access can create so you can create you can edit so these are
4:05:10
the different fields you can say different variables different types of variables you can create in service now in service catalog
4:05:19
then we have variable sets so if you want to add any variable set so you also have that option because
4:05:24
if i if you remember variable set is kind of a package for you with with multiple variables in that case if you
4:05:30
want to add any existing variable set you can do that and if you want to create a new variable set that is also
4:05:37
you have this option over here then we have some other options like catalog ui policies
4:05:43
we also have catalog client script so if you want to do some scripting you want to add some client script that is
4:05:49
something you can do here you have ui policies as well if if you you have learned about service
4:05:56
now administration i think as of now i have not uh picked that topic but we will definitely talk about ui policies
4:06:03
later but in this case ui policies are basically helpful to to make fields uh
4:06:10
read only to make fields visible mandatory you can also hide related list as well that is something you can do
4:06:16
with the help of ui policies so but but for service catalog it's a separate
4:06:21
category and that means ui policies can be created separately for service catalog forms
4:06:27
so you have catalog client scripts as well and then we have really good things here two important things that is
4:06:34
related to the related to the visibility so you have this available for and then
4:06:39
we have not available for now here you can define the visibility of the catalog
4:06:46
item which you are going to create that means you it might happen that your business might ask that whatever item
4:06:52
you are creating it should be visible to use these users or maybe it should not be visible to these users now how you
4:06:58
define those users now that is something we talked about user criteria so that is
4:07:04
not if you remember i i talked about user criteria and knowledge management as well and i mentioned over there user
4:07:11
criteria is not limited to knowledge management you can utilize in different applications similarly you can utilize
4:07:16
here as well so you can add any user criteria if you have already created if
4:07:22
not you can create new user criteria as well that is something you can mention here
4:07:28
then we have categories we already talked about it that in what categories will have for this particular catalog
4:07:35
item in which catalog this item will be added you can add definitely you can add in different catalogs
4:07:41
then we have related articles so if you have any related knowledge articles if you want to add here that is something
4:07:47
you can do and maybe related catalog items as well if you have any related catalog items uh in in for this catalog
4:07:54
item that is something you can add here as well maybe other uh catalog items maybe they are dependent or subsequent
4:08:00
conditions that is something uh i think that is the condition we are getting here but here you can just edit and add
4:08:05
different catalog items as well so this is about catalog item
4:08:12
let me show you how users will see this catalog item to submit it in that case you will see this button at
4:08:20
the top of every catalog item that is try it if you will click it it will show
4:08:25
you the end user view the form view so you can see all the variables which we have in this catalog item it is showing
4:08:31
you all those options you user can provide the input whatever input you have whatever fields you have check the
4:08:38
check box provide the date date time uh select reference field and then user can
4:08:44
click on order now that is something user can do that means request will be
4:08:50
submitted to proceed and to process the request
4:08:55
then i will show you order guide so we have here order guide as of now we
4:09:01
only have two order guides that are out of the box so let me open this one new higher
4:09:07
so as i mentioned order guide is basically kind of a bucket which which includes multiple catalog
4:09:13
items so if there is a need of of uh providing the request or or processing
4:09:21
the request for a user for multiple items in that case you don't have to ask user to
4:09:27
submit those requests individually it's better you give a package you put it into the order guide and user will
4:09:34
automatically be routed accordingly so if you will see we have this new order guide
4:09:39
and if i show you at the bottom here we have these variables so you can add these
4:09:46
variables then we have variable sets we also have rule base
4:09:51
now this rule base is something that when exactly you want to show what item
4:09:58
you can see it says include this item so i will show you quickly what exactly i'm talking about because here it's
4:10:04
mentioned different catalog items like standard laptop external monitor new email account but you can drive the
4:10:11
order guide it's it's basically depends on the condition user selects i will show you quickly how exactly it works if
4:10:18
i click on try it you can see i have this described needs
4:10:23
and i have choose options and then i can check out here i will provide some details like
4:10:29
which group this per person is joining so you have a select customer support what i need to do i will just click on
4:10:37
choose options that's my next option after filling the basic details i can
4:10:42
just click on choose option so it will take me to the next window you can see i am on this window now now
4:10:49
here you have to show the dynamic things now these are all individual catalog items and that's the important part you
4:10:55
have to understand this is not something i have created separately or individually for this order guide now
4:11:02
these are already created and if you want to utilize them while ordering uh something like a
4:11:08
package in that case you can use the same catalog item which you have created individually as well in that case you
4:11:14
have standard laptop you have external monitor you have new email account as well that is something you can request
4:11:20
for so these are different catalog items which you can add in any order guide and
4:11:25
you can just select them and just click on next tab and then you can just check out and use all the all the all the
4:11:32
different departments now the thing is it is not mandatory that all the
4:11:37
requests all the catalog items will be processed will be completed by one team
4:11:43
that's that's not possible because you have different things so it might happen that you have different departments to
4:11:48
complete these requests like new email account exchange team standard laptop maybe i t team
4:11:55
a vpn maybe some virtual team or something i'm just giving an example so in that case
4:12:00
all these requests will be routed to the different teams with the help of tasks those tasks will
4:12:06
be assigned to different team once everything will be done you will get
4:12:12
an email notification that your request is completed that's how it works as part
4:12:17
of the order guide so if you have anything which which you want to includes as part of the package you can
4:12:24
create order guides always so it's totally depend on the use case or or business case you have the requirement
4:12:30
you have from your customer as well then we have racket producers
4:12:36
so if i click on record producers
4:12:42
now here this particular module shows the list of racket producers you have in
4:12:48
your instance so as i mentioned this will create the record in one of the existing table
4:12:55
and if i open any for example server reboot
4:13:01
let's see which racket it will create so you can see it has already selected
4:13:08
table name so rather than directly on the form i will do one thing i will show you in the
4:13:13
list as well so let me show that so in that case
4:13:18
i will just add a table in this list so that you can see
4:13:23
what all different tables we have so here i have table name i will click on ok
4:13:31
so you can see it is creating records on different tables right change request ldap server you have
4:13:38
service category that is something you can create incident table as well and let's see in the next window
4:13:45
yeah i think mostly it's about uh change request i think incident it's totally up
4:13:50
to you you can definitely if i click this new button i will be able to create a new racket
4:13:56
producer and i can select any table i want which i want to create from
4:14:02
directly from the service catalog form so it totally depends how you want to show to the users now why service
4:14:10
catalog is useful if i if i give you the example of incident because you will say that you already have incident form
4:14:16
incident application now incident application is basically for idle people that means the i.t people
4:14:22
who have to work on incident but if you want end users who are not technical who are just business users who don't worry
4:14:29
about different fields you want them just to see four or five fields which are kind of maybe mandatory
4:14:35
fields to process your incident in that case you will put those variables
4:14:41
on service catalog record producer and then you will get it submitted so that's
4:14:46
that's how service catalog racket producer is used to to utilize in in this kind of business case in this kind
4:14:52
of use case basically so that's how what that's what we see about catalog items
4:14:59
order guide racket producers we talked about variables variable sets i will i
4:15:04
will quickly show you uh those variables separately because we do have a module as well so if you will go a little bit
4:15:11
bottom here here we have all variables so you can see we have this one of the
4:15:18
variable you can also select different types so we have different types of variables as well that means you can
4:15:23
create different types of variables in service now for service catalog then we have variable sets now this
4:15:30
particular will show you variable sets and i will show you what exactly i was talking about so maybe it says
4:15:36
uh common comments or maybe i will select standard employee questions now this is a variable set created
4:15:43
here you can see and that's what i was talking about requested for needed by now this variable set can be added on
4:15:50
all the forms or whatever forms wherever you want this kind of fields or variables then you can just add this
4:15:57
variable set and these two variables will automatically be added on the form
4:16:03
we talked about order we talked about order form let me show you workflow and flow
4:16:09
designer so i will go to workflow
4:16:15
here i will go to workflow so i have this workflow application and i will just click on workflow editor
4:16:23
so these are the workflows which we have in our instance let me show you the service catalog
4:16:28
workflow we have so if i type here catalog you can see i have this service catalog
4:16:36
request service catalog item request if i double click here you will be able to see this
4:16:42
workflow this is the workflow we have so you can see all the activities here
4:16:49
like set requested it will route the workflow as per the price selected by the user or the item selected by the
4:16:55
user in that case it will go for approval that's how you can customize design and you can create your own
4:17:02
workflow as per your business requirement so this is something you can attach to
4:17:08
your catalog item how to attach it if i go to catalog item
4:17:13
any catalog item so let me go to service catalog
4:17:19
and in service catalog if i go to maintain items
4:17:26
and if i just open any for example standard laptop and you will go to process engine here
4:17:33
here you can select which catalog which workflow you want to select
4:17:39
so if you have a different workflow customize workflow new workflow that is something you can select in this
4:17:44
particular field now this is for workflow but you one thing you have to remind
4:17:51
that it is not just you you cannot fill every every field here you have to you
4:17:57
have to fill only one of the racket maybe flow workflow maybe or execution plan any one
4:18:03
of them not all of them so that is something you can mention workflow then you also have flow
4:18:09
designer so if i type flow here flow designer you will find this
4:18:14
application float designer under that you have this designer it will show you all the flows you have
4:18:21
in your instance and you can create your own flow and add it here
4:18:27
then you can select that flow but if you remember only that flow you cannot create both of them workflow and flow
4:18:34
otherwise your your your request item or catalog item will not process as
4:18:40
expected so you have to select either flow workflow or execution plan so this
4:18:46
is how you can design your whole catalog item with the forms with the variables with
4:18:52
the order guide with the racket producer with variable sets with workflow and
4:18:57
flow designer this basically completes the whole package of service catalog
4:19:04
request output there are three different task tables and records associated with service
4:19:11
catalog when user place an order to request a
4:19:17
service or product it creates records related to the request
4:19:24
let's see the overall flow of these different tasks
4:19:29
when form is submitted it creates request record
4:19:36
which basically gets created in sc underscore request table
4:19:41
it is the first request when user submits the form
4:19:47
after that now this request may be let's say example it has two different items
4:19:53
two different catalog items that means user has added two different items in
4:19:58
the card so overall he is requesting one request that is your this request
4:20:04
then we have two different items one is laptop and another one is software install in that case we will have two
4:20:11
request items which will create these records in sc
4:20:17
underscore request item table req underscore item table one for laptop and another one for
4:20:24
software install now laptop and software
4:20:29
might have different process and it goes to different teams to process the request as well
4:20:36
so in that case every request item will have catalog task records
4:20:43
separately and those catalog task records will be assigned to different teams so that they
4:20:50
can process the request let me submit a catalog item so that i can show you all these records
4:20:58
so if i go to service catalog
4:21:05
and here i will go to maintain items
4:21:12
let's say i have this standard laptop so if i click this
4:21:18
i will click on try it so that i can see the form which will be
4:21:24
visible to the user now here i will just add these options as well like optional software so i will
4:21:30
just select them and then i will just click on order now if i click on order now
4:21:37
this will be submitted that's how user will order this item
4:21:44
once it is submitted it will show me the request number so it says thank you your request has
4:21:50
been submitted now this is the number i was talking about that is our eq number which basically gets created in sc
4:21:57
underscore request table so we have this request number so this
4:22:03
is the top level request now because this is the parent request now
4:22:08
for that we have an item which we have requested for and that is laptop in that case that you will see here so
4:22:14
if i will click this one that is the item included that request it can have multiple items as well and
4:22:22
that creates ritm that is something you can see here
4:22:27
as of now it is waiting for department head approval so if i go little bit bottom i have approvers let me approve
4:22:34
this so that i can show you the third task record so if i just approve this
4:22:41
let's see what happens it says it is approved and if i go
4:22:46
little bit bottom it is again asking for some approval that is cio approval that's out of the
4:22:52
box catalog item so that's the reason so i will approve this again
4:22:57
let's see what happens basically this is following the workflow i think now you will understand better
4:23:03
that how exactly so whatever workflow you have added that what all approvals it should go where exactly it should be
4:23:10
assigned that's what this catalog item will keep on following and keep on creating the racket and you will also be
4:23:16
able to see that now here we have order fulfillment this is something staged which i will talk about it later now if
4:23:23
i show you here at the bottom here we have the third task records that
4:23:28
is catalog task so if i open this one you will see this catalog task now this
4:23:36
is the final task the three tables which we were talking about this is the final task basically it is assigned to someone
4:23:42
to a team who have to work on that particular catalog item to process the request
4:23:49
so that's how you create these three different rackets on different tables
4:23:54
when user submits the request so these are all output of request catalog item
4:24:01
request stages when request is submitted by the user
4:24:06
then users can track the request by knowing the stages of the requested item
4:24:13
these stages can be created and customized by admins for different
4:24:18
items as per the business requirement so let's say an example that when laptop
4:24:24
is requested it goes to manager approval
4:24:30
because it follows the different stages so that's the first stage manager approval
4:24:36
then it goes to department head for example so that goes to department approval
4:24:43
that's the second stage then we have next stage where we have to
4:24:48
configure the laptop that means there should be a team who will fulfill the requirement
4:24:55
so that means they will configure it so that can be another stage as well
4:25:00
and the last stage we will have that is delivered in that case that means
4:25:06
employee or whomsoever has requested for that laptop has received the laptop
4:25:14
so that's how it follows different stages now as i mentioned these stages are not
4:25:20
static these are dynamic even you if you have access in service now in service
4:25:25
catalog you can also create these stages
4:25:30
let me show you these stages in my personal developer instance in one of the catalog item
4:25:36
so let's say if i'm going to catalog item again now here if i go to hardware
4:25:44
maybe i will just order this one mac pro i'm selecting these options
4:25:51
and when i'm ordering it i will be able to see the stages
4:25:56
even i can see the stages at the top of the request where it says stage field but when i am requesting it i can see
4:26:03
what all stages this request will go through so if i expand this
4:26:09
i can see all the stages you can see here it is waiting for approval first it
4:26:15
might be manager approval then it has department head approval these are all different stages you have
4:26:21
for this catalog item this is specific to this catalog item you can add any stage you want it's
4:26:28
totally up to you what stage you want for different catalog items
4:26:33
so these are different stages which any servicenow admin can customize
4:26:39
let me create all these records which we have learnt in this session
4:26:44
catalogs catalog item racket producer and other records which we learned
4:26:51
variables variable sets so let's learn about it so i will show you practically how exactly you can
4:26:58
create these different records so for that i will go to service catalog
4:27:04
application so here i have service catalog
4:27:13
so for that first i will go to maintain catalogs that is here i have my
4:27:18
catalogs and then you also have maintain catalogs so what i will do i will create a
4:27:24
catalog first so i will create a catalog new catalog here i will mentioned
4:27:30
demo for youtube i'm just i'm just giving a random name
4:27:38
here i am i'm the manager and i think that's it i will just manage
4:27:43
i will just mention here maybe uh this description
4:27:49
and i can just save it so i have created this catalog
4:27:55
now under this catalog i have to create catalog items some categories so let me create one category
4:28:02
so i will create a category and that is again demo
4:28:10
for youtube and then uh
4:28:15
then i have i don't have to select anything so i i will not select these things like icons and all i will just
4:28:21
submit it so category is also created
4:28:27
then i have catalog item so let's create that first so i will create a catalog item here
4:28:35
and i will give it a name as again demo for youtube maybe uh submit
4:28:43
i think this will be a really a good example so i will mention submit
4:28:48
training topic
4:28:54
so in that case what i will do i will select the category so we have already created a categories if you will search
4:29:01
it will only show you the category which was created for this catalog so i will be able to select this
4:29:06
category category is selected i can i can put the details if i want so
4:29:12
i can put here i can put here as well and then i have process injure i'm not
4:29:17
putting anything here it's i'm just keeping a default execution plan pricing nothing portal settings nothing
4:29:24
for now in that case i will submit it that means i will save
4:29:30
it it is saved the next thing you have to do you have to create variables but i also need to
4:29:38
add variable set so what i will do i will just add existing variable set which we already have in the system so
4:29:45
maybe i will select um standard employee questions maybe i will select that
4:29:52
uh i think i will add this one i will select this one put it here save it that
4:29:58
means this variable set will be visible on my form then i have variables what i will do i
4:30:05
will just add a variable
4:30:20
i will keep type as single text and i will put the question that question which i want to ask from the
4:30:26
user so maybe provide provide
4:30:33
training training
4:30:40
topic and if i press tab the name will automatically be populated
4:30:47
here you can see that i can put the order maybe i will put the order as 50 for now
4:30:54
yes it is mandatory so i need to put something and i can just submit it for now
4:31:01
once it is submitted you are done so you have created variables you have created variable sets i'm not creating these ui
4:31:08
policies and all you have categories catalogs and if i click on this try it button
4:31:15
i should be able to see that so you can see it is provide training topic i can mention anything like test
4:31:22
here it is already selecting who is this requested for and automatically populating as well the current user if
4:31:28
you want to change that you can change it from here it says when do you need it today or when exactly that is something
4:31:34
you can mention here and just click on order now once it is submitted
4:31:40
it it will create this request number it is also showing me the stages access
4:31:46
provide service completed and if i click this i will be able to see a request
4:31:52
item i have that is this is the requested item you can see the variables the person who will be
4:31:58
working on this request item they can see that what exactly the user has provided the data that is something i
4:32:05
can see here and then i have catalog task automatically now why exactly this these
4:32:10
catalog tasks got created the reason behind it because it has it has selected
4:32:16
that execution plan which was on catalog item if you will select workflow it will
4:32:22
follow that process if you will add flow it will pro it will follow that process
4:32:27
so it really depends what exactly you want so these execution plans are basically by default if you have some
4:32:34
maybe a regular request if you have any standard kind of process in your organization for specific items in that
4:32:41
case you can just create them by default and keep selecting tim selecting them every time
4:32:47
at the same time i can also tell you that if you will use workflow or flows
4:32:52
you can definitely make things lot of customization and dynamic when i say dynamic create one workflow and you can
4:32:59
drive your whole service catalog that is also possible most of the organizations
4:33:05
they are still following that model the developers has created develop all the developers the developers of those
4:33:11
organizations they have created those service catalog items in that way so that
4:33:16
they have done minimal scripting however they have uh they have followed
4:33:22
the dynamic model and that's that will be really helpful for you in order to save your time for development
4:33:28
perspectives in the future you have to onboard a new catalog item you don't have to write uh the workflow code again
4:33:35
you can just add those configurations and you are done and you can just onboard your new service for any
4:33:41
customer you want so this is how you create catalog item catalog and this this is how it creates
4:33:48
different tasks
4:33:55
tables and fields service now stores data in the form of database structure and it has
4:34:02
components like tables records and fields in this section we will learn about
4:34:09
tables and fields in service now how data is stored in servicenow
4:34:15
tables relationship custom and core tables we will also try to create new custom
4:34:23
tables in this session
4:34:28
servicenow data is structured as i mentioned
4:34:33
everything is managed via database structure and service now
4:34:40
you have tables which is a database component which stores records
4:34:46
then you have rackets which are stored in a table and these records have fields which show the
4:34:53
information about that particular record and then you have list
4:35:01
which shows the records in a table the list of rackets what all rackets you
4:35:06
have in that particular table that is what you can see in the list
4:35:14
servicenow data related tables as a service now administrator
4:35:21
you can access modules related to tables and columns
4:35:26
under system definition in the application navigator you will find three different applications
4:35:35
tables which have records for each table you have in your servicenow instance
4:35:42
even if you have tables in service now but all those tables are basically have
4:35:49
a different table where all those tables are mentioned what all tables you have in your instance
4:35:56
then we have tables and columns which shows an advanced view where you
4:36:01
can see all the tables and their column details
4:36:07
then you have dictionary which contains the definition of each table and field in the database of your
4:36:15
instance go to system definition application so i will type system
4:36:22
and just type definitely you will automatically get the system definition application
4:36:28
we will go to tables module this will show the list of all table
4:36:33
records of your instance now this shows tables provided by servicenow
4:36:40
and tables created by servicenow administrators as of now it is showing all the tables
4:36:47
which are out of the box because i have not created any custom table yet
4:36:52
if i click any table record
4:36:58
i can see the details of that table so let me go back
4:37:05
and i will try to search for user table so if i type here user and press enter
4:37:14
i will get this user table i can see the details of this user table
4:37:24
and some other configurations as well then you have tables and columns
4:37:32
which shows additional details of tables and columns
4:37:37
now if you select any table any table you have here
4:37:44
then you can see all the columns
4:37:49
and if you click any column maybe this one
4:37:55
then you can see more details which is basically the dictionary of that field
4:38:02
that is what you can see in tables on column
4:38:07
you can also create new table from this view you can create new application
4:38:13
you can search for some existing application you can browse applications
4:38:19
you can also create indexings if i go little bit bottom here it's it says
4:38:24
index creator so you can create indexing from different fields of a table
4:38:32
now what exactly indexing is indexing is a way to optimize the
4:38:37
performance of a database when query is processed
4:38:42
overall indexing helps you to perform better searching because if you will have lot of data
4:38:50
if you have lot of fields in that case you need to do indexing to improve the
4:38:55
performance now indexing is not service now invented
4:39:00
feature or world or terminology this is something used wherever you have
4:39:06
databases even you have indexing in your outlook
4:39:13
and you must have seen some errors sometime whenever you type any word in outlook it shows index is not completed
4:39:19
yet you might see some kind of message in outlook then we have dictionary
4:39:27
which shows the list of all columns of all the tables of your instance
4:39:32
which is also called dictionary entry and these are all dictionary entries
4:39:39
tables a table is a collection of records in the database
4:39:45
where information can be entered tables have different roles and these
4:39:51
individual rows correspond to a record in a table tables also have columns which
4:39:58
correspond to a field on racket or row as i mentioned row is a record which
4:40:05
shows the details of the racket in the form of fields and stores the data
4:40:11
these are the fields on the form now apart from these fields of racket
4:40:18
every record of a table in service now is also identified by a 32 character
4:40:25
unified id which is called cis id and that's unique
4:40:31
for every record of a table any table
4:40:40
fields as i mentioned earlier field is a column of tables which stores
4:40:48
the actual data it can be of different types like string
4:40:53
choice reference true or false the major attributes of fields are
4:41:01
field label which is the display name of a field for end users
4:41:09
field name which is kind of back in name of a field and used in scripting as well
4:41:17
and then we have field value which is the data for a racket
4:41:23
stored in that particular field let's see incident table and its fields
4:41:31
so go to tables module under system definition click on that
4:41:37
search for incident table so i will type here incident
4:41:49
here we have incident table if i click this it will open up the racket for incident table
4:41:59
now if i go a little bit down these are all columns of incident table
4:42:07
here you have related links now under related links you have this
4:42:13
show list if i click this button
4:42:19
this will show me the list of incident records that means the rackets which are in
4:42:24
incident table and this shows some columns or fields
4:42:30
you have on this view now these are the values in rows for
4:42:35
individual incidents so all these values you can see
4:42:42
on these different fields you have here now this view which you can see here
4:42:47
it's a default view users can also personalize this view by
4:42:53
changing the columns so if i click here i can personalize this list that what
4:42:59
all columns i want to see in this particular view
4:43:05
let me open any incident
4:43:11
now this is showing the details of this record on the form
4:43:16
you were seeing the details in the list first but when you open that racket you can
4:43:21
see the details of that particular record on the form now this is again not showing all the
4:43:28
fields of the table the visibility of the fields on the form
4:43:33
depends on the requirement you have from your customer
4:43:39
so it can be different for different organizations now these individual columns or fields
4:43:47
they store data for individual record
4:43:52
now as an admin you can configure these fields directly on the form
4:43:58
so if you right click on any field you will see some options
4:44:06
now in order to configure this field configure the dictionary of this field
4:44:12
you have to click on configure dictionary now this will open the dictionary record
4:44:18
of that particular field now field has two types of name
4:44:24
one is column label which is visible on the form to the
4:44:30
users and it is also visible in the list as well
4:44:36
and then we have column name which is the backend name and used in
4:44:42
scripting as well you can see the type of field as well here now there are various
4:44:48
types of field you can create in service now
4:44:54
you can also make the fields read-only and mandatory directly from
4:44:59
dictionary and then you have some other options to configure the dictionary of a field
4:45:06
for a particular table table relationships
4:45:12
as you have different tables in service now these tables can also be related to each
4:45:18
other in different ways the first relationship we have is one
4:45:25
too many in which one table has some fields which are referencing to other tables
4:45:33
like reference fields or glide list fields
4:45:38
as an example you can have multiple incidents as user table is on incident
4:45:44
table referenced in caller field this way user table has one too many
4:45:51
relationship with incident table then we have many-to-many relationship
4:45:59
in which two or more tables are related to each other as an example group and roles table
4:46:06
which are related to group roles table and lastly we have extended relationship
4:46:13
in which one or more tables can be extended from another table
4:46:19
which are also inherited the fields from the parent table
4:46:24
so basically if you extend any table from any other table you also extend the
4:46:30
fields as well created in parent table as an example you have task table
4:46:38
and incident and change table are extended from task tables
4:46:44
you will find some fields on incident chain tables which are inherited from task tables
4:46:50
go to incident list so i will just type incident
4:46:56
and here i have list of incidents now if i open any incident
4:47:06
i can see this caller field now this caller field is basically referencing to
4:47:12
user table that means user might have multiple
4:47:17
incidents and this is one too many relationship with incident table for user table
4:47:23
you can see this this particular record is coming from user table
4:47:29
this is not an incident table then we have many-to-many relationship
4:47:36
in that case you have to see group table so we have this
4:47:42
groups table here then we have role table
4:47:50
now both are basically related to each other with many too many relationships in this table so we have this group
4:47:57
roles table and you can see multiple groups which have multiple roles as well
4:48:05
that means these have many too many relationship
4:48:10
let's see extended table so if you go to incident table
4:48:22
and if i open configuration of this table you will see this particular field extends table
4:48:30
that means this table incident table is extended from task
4:48:36
table that means this table is called extended table
4:48:41
and that's how it's called extended relationship
4:48:46
similarly you also have problem so if i look for problem record
4:48:55
you will see that that is also extended from task table if i go to
4:49:01
table configuration you can see it says accents table and it
4:49:06
is extending task table as well and i can open this particular table
4:49:14
and you have all these fields so remember as i told you that this is a
4:49:19
task table now incident and problem and other tables
4:49:25
they are extending from task table so whatever fields you have in this
4:49:30
table you will have those fields on these extended tables as well like
4:49:35
incident and problem types of tables
4:49:41
service now has different types of tables which are categorized as per the
4:49:46
structure they have servicenow administrators and developers
4:49:52
need to know which type of table they want to meet the business requirement before starting the development and
4:49:59
creation of a table these tables are
4:50:04
base tables extended tables
4:50:10
core tables and custom tables
4:50:18
base tables a base table is a table which is not extended from any other
4:50:25
table and referred to as a parent table or parent
4:50:30
class but extends other tables as an example task table
4:50:38
which is not extended from any other table but extends table like change
4:50:46
incident problem
4:50:52
extended tables a table which is extended from another
4:50:57
table is called extended table like we have change table
4:51:04
incident table problem table which are basically extended from task
4:51:11
table and the table which is getting extended is referred as child class
4:51:19
and the one from which these tables are extended is referred as parent class
4:51:27
another example of base table is configuration item table from which tables like hardware
4:51:35
software applications are extended
4:51:42
core and custom tables core tables are created by service now
4:51:49
which are in the base system and custom tables are tables which are
4:51:55
created by developer or administrator
4:52:01
the example of core tables are task change
4:52:06
incident an example of custom tables which are created by developers or administrators
4:52:13
like leave mapping table or any metrics table like
4:52:18
approvalmetrics table in order to see base tables you can go to
4:52:26
tables module and you can search for the tables which
4:52:32
are not basically extended they are not getting extended from any
4:52:38
other table so if i go to this column extends table
4:52:43
and i put a filter here that means i just put show matching that means wherever extended from is empty this
4:52:51
extends table is empty in this case you will see all the tables
4:52:58
which are basically not extended and you will also find task table in it
4:53:05
so let's see if i search for it yes you have task table here and you can see
4:53:11
extends table is empty so that's how you can search for base
4:53:16
tables now tables like incident
4:53:22
change problem they are core tables
4:53:27
so if i click here again and just look
4:53:32
for incident table so i have this incident table
4:53:38
now these are core tables which came from servicenow directly out of the box
4:53:43
for different applications of servicenow so all the applications which are
4:53:48
directly coming from servicenow out of the box those are core tables
4:53:54
now let me create a new custom table so that's how you will learn what
4:54:00
exactly the custom table is because custom table is not available in
4:54:06
service now out of the box you have to create servicenow administrator service now developers
4:54:12
have to create as per the business requirement they get from different customers or clients
4:54:19
so as you can see i have this option here so i will also create a new table and show you to add few fields
4:54:27
and show you that how exactly it works when you create a new table what kind of fields you get automatically created
4:54:34
when you create a new custom table so if i click on this button new
4:54:41
you will see this table form here i can give the label name
4:54:47
now as of now i'm just giving demo space
4:54:53
youtube now the functionality we have in servicenow
4:54:59
for custom table when you press tab it will automatically create a name for
4:55:05
you you can see here but the one thing to
4:55:11
see but one thing to focus on is
4:55:18
naming convention you can see as i have created this custom table it has automatically added
4:55:26
you underscore so wherever you see you underscore that is a custom table if it's a global
4:55:34
scope we have we have never talked about scope but now has two different scopes global
4:55:41
and private scope as well but even if it's a custom table for private scope in that case you will see
4:55:48
the identifier for private scope as well so here it it shows the name of the
4:55:56
table now by while creating it if you want to extend it you can extend it from task
4:56:01
table and i will show you it will inherit all the fields so what i will do first i will just create a random table
4:56:08
without extending it from task table i can also create the module for any application if i want that is something
4:56:15
you can select here if you will uncheck it will just create a table it will not create that module in application
4:56:22
navigator under any application so i'm just unchecking it for now and then here i have dictionary entries
4:56:29
that means you can create columns fields for your table so for example i will
4:56:34
just add name now i will make it the type as strings
4:56:41
as i mentioned you can create different types of uh fields so
4:56:46
let me show you them see we have 52 types of fields you can create
4:56:53
so as of now i will just select a string press enter i will get string
4:56:59
here i will select it no reference max length will be automatically selected i don't want any
4:57:05
default value for now and i can just save it before that if you see we have some
4:57:10
other tabs like controls if it is extensible you want to you want to make it extensible that means some
4:57:16
other tables can extend it that is something you can check this box if you want some naming convention numbering
4:57:22
automatically that is something you can mention here this is something role specific if you want to provide any role
4:57:27
so that these users if users will have this role then only they will be able to access the table
4:57:33
maybe read access write access or delete access so i will show you when you will create or save this particular record
4:57:39
then we have application access then how people can access this table that kind of configuration you can mention here
4:57:46
now let me just save it first once this is saved
4:57:57
it is saved and if you will go to columns you will see some extra fields
4:58:05
which you didn't even create yourself now these fields will be created
4:58:11
automatically every time you will create a new table your custom field will definitely be
4:58:18
there but these six fields at the top will be created automatically like created by
4:58:25
which shows the person who has created this racket that is what it shows
4:58:31
then we have created the person when exactly this racket was created the whatever record will be
4:58:37
created it will show that particular time then we have society the the one unique
4:58:43
id which we were talking about for each record then we have updates if we have any
4:58:50
updates to the uh to the racket then we have updated by
4:58:55
then we have updated when this racket was updated and then we have name which
4:59:00
is our custom field and you can add multiple fields you want you can add here as per your business requirement
4:59:08
now as of now it shows these fields now let me create another table which we
4:59:15
will extend from task table and you will see a lot of difference so if i click on
4:59:20
new again i will just close this message
4:59:28
here i will select just demo youtube
4:59:36
task if i press enter it will select the name you can also change it if you want
4:59:42
now the important part is here extends table so let me extend it from task
4:59:48
now you will see the magic which i was talking about that it inherits all the tables from parent table that
4:59:55
means this parent table we are talking about so i'm not g going to create my custom
5:00:00
field for now and i'm not going to create any module well let's let's do that maybe you will
5:00:06
be able to see that so maybe we will add this module to maybe self-service
5:00:11
let's see if we can see that so i have added this to self-service and
5:00:16
i'm going to save this but before that let me check this auto
5:00:21
number as well we will have them and
5:00:27
that's it and i will just save this once i will save this you will see all those fields
5:00:38
let's go to columns you can see we got these 69 fields which we didn't
5:00:45
even create self now these fields are basically from
5:00:50
task table so that is what we were talking about because this has extended this table is basically being extended
5:00:56
from task table so it will inherit all the fields of task table
5:01:03
let's add some custom fields on code tables like incident change
5:01:08
problem so if i go to tables
5:01:15
let me search for any table maybe like change
5:01:21
i have this change request so for change management we have this
5:01:27
change request table so you have that opportunity if i go a little bit bottom here
5:01:33
[Music] i can add any new field and i can make it visible on the form as well
5:01:41
so if i show you show form
5:01:46
as of now we have these fields now as a servicenow administrator as a
5:01:52
service not developer if you have a new requirement to add any new field so what you can do you can just go here
5:01:58
go to form layout and i can create any new field like
5:02:05
maybe i will just do test make a string for now i will click on add
5:02:11
now i will show you how exactly it will be added in the table as well so as of
5:02:16
now i'm creating it from the form layout but i will just show you
5:02:22
so i have here and i will save it
5:02:32
it is succeeded i will close
5:02:37
you can see i have this new field test here the custom field which we just
5:02:43
created now i can show you this field in the table as well so let me go to the table
5:02:53
so here's the table we have and if i see yep you can see here we
5:03:01
have that test table you can delete it as well if you want so if i just cross this here and save it
5:03:09
that field will be deleted it's done it's deleted and if i go
5:03:16
at the bottom here and if i click on show form then you
5:03:21
will not see that field anymore you can see that field is gone
5:03:27
because you have deleted it from that particular view from table uh configuration view
5:03:34
table schema map schema map is a graphical representation
5:03:40
of tables related to other tables it shows the relationship between the
5:03:46
tables map you can go to tables and columns under system
5:03:52
definition select any table
5:03:57
let's search for incident table so if i select incident
5:04:11
so i have this incident table now here you have schema map
5:04:17
so if i click on schema map i should be able to see the schema map
5:04:23
for incident table now in this map it shows different configurations like you have reference
5:04:31
tables referencing tables extended tables show access to extending tables as well
5:04:37
that is something you can select here so you can see like this incident is basically you have incident task
5:04:44
you have security incident that means it is the referencing table that means these tables basically they have a
5:04:50
reference of incident table on this table that is what it is talking
5:04:57
about then we have other tables you have like configuration item you have change
5:05:03
request where exactly you are referencing incident that is something you can see that means on incident you
5:05:10
have these relationships as well if you want to see the columns you can see that
5:05:15
from here that's how you can see lot of detail some relationships directly from
5:05:20
table schema map and that's that's the reason it's called graphical representation that what all fields you
5:05:26
have what all columns you have how exactly different tables are related to each other that is something you can see
5:05:32
in this particular view access control list
5:05:38
which are also called acl servicenow has different level of
5:05:44
securities to access data into servicenow
5:05:49
this accessibility of data can be controlled with the help of acls
5:05:54
in this section we will learn about acls in service now types of permissions and service now
5:06:01
how to define access control for tables and fields and we will also try to create new acls
5:06:09
in servicenow and my personal developer instance
5:06:16
types of permission service now provides different level of securities
5:06:22
for a user before he takes any action in the system the first security is login
5:06:30
which is basically controlled on the basis of user group and roles
5:06:36
login is also the first level of security which is mandatory to be authenticated before interacting with ui
5:06:42
of service now next level of security we have is
5:06:48
applications and modules once a user is logged in
5:06:54
the next level of security is visibility of applications and modules which is on the basis of roles assigned
5:07:01
to a user logged in user tables and rackets
5:07:08
if a user has access to the modules he can also see the list of records for
5:07:14
a particular table however those rackets will only be visible and editable if the user has
5:07:22
required access these accesses for tables and records
5:07:27
are based on acl which are also called access control
5:07:32
list what is access control
5:07:40
access control is a kind of security rule which is defined to restrict the
5:07:45
permission of a user to interact with tables and records moreover data we have in service now
5:07:54
it is the highest level of security which can be applied at table level
5:08:01
racket level which is called a row level axis
5:08:06
and then we have field level which is called column level access
5:08:13
operations restricted there are a number of operations which can be restricted with
5:08:19
the help of access control rules for users like crude operations
5:08:26
which is basic operation for any database crude is basically
5:08:33
create operation users cannot create the racket
5:08:38
if restriction is applied if they have access they can create the racket
5:08:44
so that's called create operation then we have read
5:08:51
users cannot read the racket or field if restriction is applied
5:08:58
then we have update operation in which users cannot update or edit
5:09:05
records or fields if restriction is applied
5:09:10
and then we have delete operation and that's how it make crude
5:09:17
now in delete operations user cannot delete the record if restriction is
5:09:22
applied so as i mentioned it's a basic operations of any database
5:09:30
users can do create read update or delete
5:09:39
with these crude operations we also have some servicenow specific
5:09:45
operations so you can apply these restrictions
5:09:50
on your different rackets and fields and service now but you can add some
5:09:56
actions operations specific to service now that is
5:10:02
execute that means if restriction is applied users cannot execute a script on a
5:10:10
record then we have added ci relations
5:10:17
in this users cannot add relationships in cmdb
5:10:23
then we have save as template service now has a template functionality
5:10:29
if you will apply this restriction then users cannot see that field to be available to create the templates
5:10:38
so you can create templates for different fields on a particular table
5:10:43
but if you will apply that restriction that only specific users should use that
5:10:48
field for template then it will be applied like the same
5:10:53
and users cannot use those fields for save as template
5:10:59
then we have report on users cannot create reports
5:11:07
and then we have personalized choice users cannot right click on the field
5:11:13
and configure choices of the feed so if you will apply some restrictions
5:11:19
related to personalized choice then they cannot right click on the field and
5:11:24
configure the options you have for choice
5:11:30
fields so these are the operations which you can apply in service now
5:11:37
with the help of acls
5:11:42
security modules servicenow provides three modules
5:11:49
where you can do configurations for security permissions of the platform
5:11:55
the first one is security module which is under system properties
5:12:02
which has different properties to configure the security of the platform
5:12:08
then we have high security settings which has properties to configure
5:12:14
high-level security permissions of the platform and this module is available under
5:12:20
system security application the second module we have under system
5:12:26
security is acl where you will find list of different
5:12:32
security rules on your instance tables
5:12:37
and as i mentioned this application is available under system security application
5:12:44
so whenever you have to create some rules for different tables for different
5:12:50
records and you have to put some securities you have to put some constraints for
5:12:57
different users and you got the requirement from your customers in that case you can create access
5:13:03
controls access control list
5:13:12
access control list is a list of defined rules which are called access control
5:13:19
these rules are created at tables rackets and field level
5:13:25
if you are a servicenow administrator you can create or modify these rules
5:13:30
however you also need to elevate the access to high level security to work on
5:13:36
the access control list rules i will show you later that how exactly you can enable the elevated access
5:13:45
but to elevate the access you should have security underscore admin role
5:13:51
access control form and fields this is the access control form which
5:13:58
you will see while editing or creating rules in service now the important fields of access control
5:14:05
are type of acl here you select what type of acl is this
5:14:12
most developers and admins use record type however you can also use other types
5:14:18
like rest endpoint which is used for integrations acl
5:14:24
next field we have is operation in this field you select for which operation acl
5:14:29
is being applied read update or others
5:14:35
which we talked about earlier then we have admin override
5:14:41
this checkbox will always allow admins to perform the operation regardless of any condition mentioned in
5:14:48
the acl which means it will override the acl so if you want
5:14:54
admin to perform the action regardless of the condition you mentioned in the rule
5:14:59
then you have to check this box but if you want to apply that security
5:15:04
rule for all the users even he has admin access then you can uncheck this box
5:15:14
in this section where you select the table and object you want to apply the acl and
5:15:21
this is the important part here so you have to select the table and on which
5:15:26
on which table you want to apply this acl and then you have to select the
5:15:31
object now what are these objects
5:15:37
we will talk about it later
5:15:42
then we have description here you mentioned the details of acl
5:15:47
which you are going to create the permissions provided by acl
5:15:55
are based on three conditions which are mentioned in three sections
5:16:04
required roles condition which is mentioned here
5:16:12
and then you have custom script so you can write the custom code if you
5:16:17
cannot achieve it with the help of requires role or condition
5:16:24
then we have execution plan now here if you will click this button
5:16:31
you will see a pop-up which will show the execution plan that
5:16:36
what kind of access you have on this particular acl
5:16:42
what what kind of acl have been applied that is something you can see here
5:16:52
acl rule types now here i was talking about the
5:16:58
important section where you exactly mention that which
5:17:03
particular element which particular object has to uh has to be configured
5:17:08
for rules for security so while creating an acl you need to
5:17:16
provide the name where you specify which objects needs to be restricted
5:17:23
so you have three types of acl which you can apply on
5:17:28
one is table dot none that means you select the table
5:17:34
and you don't select anything in the second field
5:17:39
now this type of rule is applied on the whole table which is selected with all the records
5:17:47
so if you want to apply security constraint for any particular table in
5:17:52
that case you can create this kind of acl
5:17:57
then we have table dot star or asterisk
5:18:02
now if you will select table that means like incident and in second field you select star
5:18:09
that's another option you will see now this type of rule is applied on
5:18:14
every field of a record in the table so for example user has access to the
5:18:20
table but if you want the user should not see all the fields that is something you can
5:18:26
do table dot star so whatever code you will write whatever condition you will write whatever
5:18:32
required roles you will select it will be applied accordingly for all the records of that table
5:18:40
and lastly we have a table dot field in which rule is applied on a specific
5:18:47
field of the table so for example user has access to the table
5:18:54
and all the rackets but you want to apply
5:18:59
rules on specific fields and you would you don't want those two fields visible to maybe uh some kind of roles
5:19:08
in that case you can create this kind of rule as well let's see these acl rules in details
5:19:17
so in table dot none all the users who are qualifying the condition mentioned in the acl can see
5:19:24
all problem records if they don't have access or
5:19:29
they don't match condition as per the conditions mentioned in the acl then
5:19:34
they can't see those records that means they will not have access to
5:19:40
the table then we have table dot star
5:19:46
in table dot star all users who are qualifying the condition mentioned in the acl can see all problem
5:19:54
records fields so they can see the problem brackets at the same time they can see all the
5:20:01
problem racket fields and they will have all the access
5:20:08
and then we have table dot field so in table dot field all the users who
5:20:15
are qualifying the condition mentioned in the acl can only see the data in the field selected in that
5:20:22
particular access rule and if they don't have access
5:20:28
and if they don't match the condition which is mentioned in the acl then they will not be able to see that particular
5:20:35
field the value available in that particular field and the best part of acl is let me tell
5:20:43
you that it is also applied in reporting so it doesn't mean that if user is not
5:20:48
able to see the data on the form they cannot see the data from reporting as
5:20:53
well and that's what we say that acls are the highest level of security you
5:20:58
can apply in service now how acl works
5:21:04
so let's say example users tries to log into service now and he will try to access the racket
5:21:11
but before servicenow shows that racket data to user it it process something in the back end
5:21:18
that means it tries to find acl for the same object
5:21:24
and also tries to find the matching rule so whatever object user is trying to
5:21:30
access sister first check do i have similar kind of access rule for that
5:21:36
object so if the answer is no so system did not find any matching rule
5:21:44
any kind of acl for that object then access is granted to the user that means
5:21:51
user can access that data but if match is found that means system
5:21:58
found yes there is a matching rule in the system for that particular object
5:22:05
then it would basically evaluate the acl so whatever condition it would have in
5:22:10
that particular acl that will try to evaluate and then it will pass the acl
5:22:18
that means yes i have found it it will evaluate so if it is passing the acl
5:22:23
then it will grant the access so if user is able to match the
5:22:29
condition which is mentioning in the acl then it will grant the access and if it is not passing the acl
5:22:37
that means the condition which is mentioned in the acl is not as per the user's role maybe users group maybe or
5:22:45
whatever condition mentioned in the system then it will not grant the access access
5:22:51
will not be granted to the user and user will not be able to see the data which he is trying to look for
5:22:59
but that's how this acl works in servicenow now let me take you to my personal
5:23:06
developer instance and i will try to create some brackets
5:23:11
and i will show you how acl works i will show you the acl module as well
5:23:18
this is my personal developer instance as i mentioned earlier
5:23:24
the first level of security in servicenow is login
5:23:29
so user has to be authenticated and log into service now before he accessed the
5:23:35
data so let me log in first so i will enter username and the password
5:23:42
and press enter
5:23:47
now as of now i am an administrator so i can see basically all the data which i am
5:23:54
allowed to see so let me show you the acl module first
5:24:00
so in application navigator i will type access space control if you will just
5:24:07
type con you will automatically get under system security you will find this
5:24:12
module so if you will click on this access control you will see the list of all acls
5:24:19
created all the rules applied and created for various tables of your
5:24:24
instance now if i search for incident table for example
5:24:31
so before that i will do one thing i will check if i can select
5:24:37
table so but i have to do it in the name so i i will go here and i will
5:24:43
mention maybe incident
5:24:50
yep so i have this incident now all these rules which you can see here
5:24:56
these rules are basically applied for incident management incident
5:25:02
table and these are the acls for incident table and records
5:25:08
and you can see we have operations like read delete create execute write we can
5:25:14
also group them so if i click here and i can just click here group by operation you will
5:25:22
see the different types of acls have been created for incident management
5:25:29
so you can see here now as of now you can see i i'm not getting uh this new button here
5:25:36
but you can get it how if you remember i told you in order to do that you have to elevate
5:25:42
your access now in order to elevate the access you should also have security admin role so
5:25:49
let me see so if you click on your profile here you will see this elevate roles
5:25:54
that means i do have that particular role to enable it so that means i have security underscore admin role so if i
5:26:02
click here i will see this option here i have to check that box and if i click on ok you
5:26:10
will see the difference now you can see now i'm getting this access
5:26:16
control new button that means in order to enable this new button in order to work on access
5:26:21
control you can see the data you can read the data but if you have to create new rules if you have to edit some
5:26:28
existing rules in that case you have to elevate the role first and then only you can create new acls and edit any any
5:26:37
acls you have in your instance now let me show you some security rules
5:26:42
which automatically gets created when you create a table so i will go to tables module so i will
5:26:50
go to tables so here i have tables i will just click
5:26:57
on this module i will get this new button so i will click on new
5:27:05
so i will create a random table maybe i will mention acl demo
5:27:11
press tab name will be selected i don't want to extend from any any
5:27:17
other table i will maybe maybe i will not create any module for
5:27:22
now i will just uncheck this and then i will just create few fields
5:27:29
maybe just one field for now or maybe two let's let's create two fields so one is uh maybe test one
5:27:38
and i will save this i will put it as a string type will be string
5:27:46
and then i will put test two and i will make it as string as well
5:27:54
selected and now i am saving this table but before that let me show you some
5:28:00
other options as well so i have here controls so you can see it says create access
5:28:07
control now you can select any new role you want that is something you can do that means
5:28:14
you can select it you can select the role here and you you want to create any access control you can check this box
5:28:21
or if you don't want then you can uncheck it so as of now you can see i will create a role here and i can add as
5:28:27
well so you can also select different roles if you want as of now it's just giving me so maybe i can
5:28:33
just uncheck it if i want or maybe check but let's see the difference what exactly will happen
5:28:39
uh then i have application access yeah just a configuration just to access the
5:28:44
data for this table so as of now i will just keep as it is and i will save it so
5:28:49
what difference you will see you can see you will see that we have this role and i will just click on save
5:28:57
now once you will click on save this table will be created
5:29:02
however you will see some extra records and as i mentioned some of the access roles will be created
5:29:10
automatically with all those four crude operations
5:29:15
create read write and delete
5:29:21
so these are the three these are the four acls which will be created automatically
5:29:27
so let me open one of the acl here so if i open this acl
5:29:35
this is the acl racket that means the access control rule which
5:29:40
automatically got created so you will see the same role
5:29:45
here not any other condition that is something we have not applied as of now because this is automatically created by
5:29:52
default when you create any table and when you check that box you get those
5:29:57
acl automatically applied with the role here now let's create another table
5:30:04
and see if if these records are created or not but as you can see we have four four
5:30:11
roles basically four access control rules and it has this particular role
5:30:16
now what exactly it means it means the user who will have this
5:30:22
particular role can create the racket can update the racket can delete the record that is what you can do in this
5:30:30
table if user will not have this role then they cannot
5:30:35
so let me create another table first so i will go to tables
5:30:41
and i will click on new
5:30:47
and now i will just maybe just acl demo
5:30:52
second this is second table we are creating press tab
5:30:57
i don't want any module right now and i will just uh click on columns
5:31:03
and i will mention here test one then i will give a type as string
5:31:13
and then i will mention test2 and here i will make it as string again
5:31:21
well let's find this one and in controls i will uncheck this box
5:31:27
and i will save it let's see what happens
5:31:34
so as i have unchecked this box and i have saved the table you can see it has not created
5:31:40
acls automatically and with that role as well no roles have been applied
5:31:46
now in this case you have to add custom roles because it has not added any role
5:31:53
automatically now let me show you how exactly this works
5:31:59
so maybe i will do one thing in my another browser i will open a same instance but i will
5:32:06
impersonate a different user or maybe i can show you in this particular in this particular session as well so
5:32:12
let me let me do that first so in that case i will go to uh maybe i will i will create a module
5:32:19
of this particular uh table so for that i will maybe create another
5:32:25
table or maybe i will just add this particular module in any application maybe in
5:32:31
self service so i will click on this
5:32:37
i will create a new module
5:32:42
so i will go here and i will do link type list of records
5:32:48
here i will select the table which we have just created so i will type acl
5:32:54
i'm sure i will get that table acl so we have this demo and demo second
5:33:00
so we will create it for both the tables and i can just uh
5:33:06
as of now nothing i'm not adding any kind of role to to access the module so
5:33:13
i will just put here maybe 10 000 and title i can give
5:33:20
or maybe demo acl
5:33:25
and i will submit it
5:33:31
so it is submitted that means that module is created let's see yep we do have uh
5:33:36
let me check i think as of now it's not added but we will see i'm sure it should be there
5:33:45
yep we have it here demo acl i think we wanted to add it on the top but it is at the
5:33:52
bottom but that's fine that is still okay then we have demo acl
5:34:00
second and then i can add here list of records
5:34:06
and i can select acl and i will select this table
5:34:12
and i will go to visibility nothing and i will just click on submit
5:34:20
now i am logged in as an administrator as you know that so i have this
5:34:25
particular module here i don't have any records i have but
5:34:30
access to create the rackets here i have this acl so i can create
5:34:36
anything i want here i can submit it and i can see the records
5:34:42
now if i go at the top i have this demo acl second if i click here
5:34:48
here also i have create access you can see and i can create the record
5:34:54
so maybe i will just uh like this and i can create the records here but
5:35:00
let me impersonate with any other user so i will click on impersonate and let
5:35:06
me impersonate with itel user if i go here
5:35:13
now i can see the table the module basically which we created so if i click here you can see i cannot
5:35:21
access because there was no security rule so i cannot access this table anymore
5:35:28
and if i go bottom and if i click here let's see the difference here as well because i don't
5:35:34
have that role which was assigned to this particular table now how can i get access to this table
5:35:42
so for that i have to end the impersonation
5:35:48
and now i have to go to acl so if i go to
5:35:53
maybe before that before because we already have four acls for demo acl
5:35:59
table that means the acl demo table we created we have those four acls so let's see if
5:36:06
i can access that data but for that what i can do i can just go to sis user
5:36:13
dot list i will access that
5:36:18
user first so i have itil here i have this idle user
5:36:29
i will add that role into this user
5:36:37
now if you remember the role we had i think acl
5:36:43
yep we have this role so i will just add it so i have added this role to the user
5:36:50
now let's see if this user can access this particular module records that
5:36:55
means table records so i will impersonate that i will go to itel user i will
5:37:01
impersonate it user now let's see so if i go a little bit bottom
5:37:08
i can see it let's see yep you can see that i can see these records
5:37:15
initially i was not able to do that but now i can see that now let's change something else so i can
5:37:23
see both the fields the data we have in both the fields i can see that
5:37:28
let's say one thing i want to hide this particular this particular field data
5:37:34
from this user specifically maybe or maybe i don't want to i just want to
5:37:39
show this data to a specific user so in that case what i will do i will first end the impersonation
5:37:46
now if you will get this requirement from your customer because you have to hide the data and you have to put some
5:37:52
constraint for a specific fields in that case i will
5:37:57
go to this table first how i will do that i will go to the list first
5:38:05
go to securities so we have the security rules
5:38:10
so as of now you know we have just those four security rules for this particular table now this is just for all
5:38:17
that's the reason nothing is here so let me show you that so we have those
5:38:23
four rules here so what i will do i will first elevate the role
5:38:29
click on ok now why we have not that elevated role because that's session based so
5:38:35
succession is gone there's a limited time and i have to enable it again so i
5:38:41
will click on create new so i'm going to create a new access control rule for a table so in that case
5:38:48
it will be record level and i will do read
5:38:54
here i will add that particular table so that is acl
5:39:01
if i select that let's see yep we got it acl demo and here
5:39:07
i will select one of the field test two so maybe i don't want to show
5:39:12
a test to field to few users so in that case what i will do
5:39:18
i will mention that only admin people can see that field data
5:39:24
so if i will click on save
5:39:31
it is applied done and i can click on continue
5:39:38
it is done let's see if it works or not so i will go to
5:39:45
and impersonate will go to idle user then
5:39:50
and if i go a little bit bottom and if i go to demo acl
5:39:56
you can see now i cannot see that field anymore i can't even access that data even if i
5:40:03
open the form let's see if i'm able to see that you can see i'm not even able to see
5:40:10
that field anymore the data not field this is how you can apply the acls and
5:40:16
it has really great powers so if you want really good security
5:40:22
rules to be applied always rule always use acls if you want to restrict some data into
5:40:29
servicenow that's best you have some sensitive data because you might have multiple users in
5:40:35
logged into your instances so in that case if you have a critical requirement from your customers from your clients in
5:40:42
that case you can apply that rule so this is how you hide the data from
5:40:49
from for different users from for your customers and clients and that's how you apply acls
5:40:57
data import service now administrators and users can
5:41:03
import data into different tables of service now in this section we will learn about how
5:41:10
data can be imported into service now we will learn about import sets and
5:41:15
transform maps we will learn about cola's fields and we will also learn about data
5:41:21
policies to import data into service now
5:41:27
need of data import before we learn about importing data into service now it's important to know
5:41:35
why we need to import data into servicenow system
5:41:40
you might get the requirement from different users to bulk upload the data into service now in different tables so
5:41:48
that you don't need to do manual creation of those rackets
5:41:54
as an example you can import the data from active directory
5:42:00
users and groups data can be imported from active directory which get inserted or updated into user or group table
5:42:08
respectively you can also import data from hr system
5:42:15
some organizations they also import employees data directly from hr system
5:42:20
into servicenow you can import knowledge articles
5:42:27
so you might need to import knowledge articles from external system or word documents or any other format
5:42:37
you would also get the requirement to import import assets you might need to pull assets
5:42:43
information for another system or applications and put them into asset management table or cmdb tables
5:42:52
we will learn about cmdb in our next section
5:43:00
ways of data import there are different ways you can import
5:43:06
data into service now it is important to know when to use
5:43:11
these ways to import data the first way is import xml
5:43:19
which only imports xml file that is also for the table you have in
5:43:24
service now so this is the mostly used by developers
5:43:30
or administrators to move data from different service now instances
5:43:37
now you will find this feature when you open the list context menu so if you are an administrator and you will you will
5:43:45
click on the list context menu you will see this import xml option
5:43:50
when you will click on that import xml option it will show new screen to you where you can upload the xml file from
5:43:57
your local system now another way is to import data as
5:44:04
import which you get on the same list context menu
5:44:11
that means import uses the functionality of import sets and transform map which is the core
5:44:17
feature of import data into servicenow
5:44:22
when you click on import you will see new screen to upload the file which you have in your system
5:44:30
you can only import excel file with this option
5:44:35
you will also find an option to download the template provide the data mention the data in
5:44:42
that excel sheet and then upload that data back into service now which will update the tables in service
5:44:49
now and last we have import sets
5:44:55
which is the core functionality of servicenow for importing data
5:45:01
import set is used to is used data from various sources so basically you can import data from
5:45:07
various sources and map that data into different service now tables
5:45:13
a user with admin or import underscore admin role can import data into service
5:45:20
now servicenow has a separate application called system import sets which is used
5:45:27
to manage imports in service now
5:45:33
import sets components let's talk about more
5:45:38
about import sets and its components so there are various components in
5:45:45
import sets which process the import of data into servers now
5:45:52
first is data source a source of rackets from where data
5:45:58
needed need need to be imported it can be a file on a network it can be an attachment in service now
5:46:06
it can be ldap or it can be any kind of jdbc connection with servicenow
5:46:13
so data source is something from where exactly you want to import that data it will be a file in any any any system you
5:46:21
have all the possibilities i mentioned then you have import set table
5:46:28
import set table is a staging area for rackets to be imported from source
5:46:34
before data is inserted or updated into the actual target table it stays in
5:46:40
staging table which has fields related to the source data and the name of this import set table is
5:46:46
based on the name of the file you try to import so it's kind of a
5:46:53
staging table so before putting anything into the real table the actual table
5:46:58
you you put that source data first into this table then that data is being transformed
5:47:06
then you have transform map transform map is used to create the relationship between fields of source
5:47:14
data and target table as an example i can give you a quick
5:47:19
example like you have incident table and you might have some data maybe
5:47:25
outside maybe with excel or maybe some other data or maybe some other source
5:47:31
so it is not mandatory that other other source also has same kind of fields
5:47:38
maybe you have access we have an excel sheet which has just two columns maybe uh in in place of number it says
5:47:44
something else or maybe numbering and the second column you have may be
5:47:51
assigned and assigned to person but here as a external source excel sheet you
5:47:56
have maybe uh assignment now how would you make sure that these
5:48:02
two columns should be uh should should go into the incident table in service
5:48:07
now and should only update number and assign to now here it comes the
5:48:14
transform map where you map the fields and that's how it comes mapping assist
5:48:20
so mapping assist provides a visual way to map fields of source data and target
5:48:26
data you map them that which field should be mapped to what field of your servicenow system
5:48:33
mapping can also be done automatically so in transform map when you will create the transform app service now will give
5:48:40
you an option to create these mappings automatically
5:48:45
then we have colis callis is used to trigger a check before importing of data if it is enabled on a
5:48:52
field then system will check for existing record if match found the same record is
5:48:59
updated else new record is inserted coles is i would say very important
5:49:04
functionality of importing data into servicenow and then we have target table that's the
5:49:12
main table where you have to import the data so after all these processing the data
5:49:19
will be imported in this actual table and that is the target table this is my personal developer instance
5:49:27
i will start with showing the example of import xml
5:49:33
that is one of the way to import data into service now
5:49:39
so let's say if i go to problem or maybe incident i will go to incident
5:49:48
i will come here i have these records maybe i will just
5:49:56
here and i have this short description so i will open this record
5:50:02
here short description is empty what i will do i will
5:50:08
export this data and format i will take like this xml this record so i will
5:50:14
click on xml this record so i got the xml record what i will do i
5:50:20
will try to edit that record now the xml file is opened here
5:50:27
in edit mode now you can see whatever fields you have on incident table
5:50:34
when i exported that racket into xml it it pulled out all all the fields i have
5:50:40
you can see all the fields in xml format
5:50:45
so in that case i would look for short description and i will try to update it so let's see
5:50:52
where we have short description
5:50:58
so if i search for short description
5:51:06
so here i have short description now what i can do i can
5:51:13
remove this and i can
5:51:20
copy this i will i will provide a value here and then i can
5:51:28
just slash and then i will do this is
5:51:34
a demo for importing
5:51:43
importing data so i have i'm done with this i will
5:51:48
close this what i will do i will save this xml so i should have
5:51:56
say what i will do i will just click on save so this xml is saved
5:52:01
i will close this i will go back to my instance
5:52:07
i'm here now if you remember to import any data via this import xml you have to go to
5:52:14
the list view and one thing i want to just make a note here that you can open any list you want
5:52:22
it doesn't matter servicenow will automatically recognize that table and will insert or update that table it will
5:52:29
not uh import that data into somewhere else so maybe let me show you that as well so let me open problem
5:52:36
let's see so i am in problem i'm just doing import xml so here is the
5:52:44
feature i will click on choose file
5:52:50
i will go to the downloads where my file was downloaded i will select the same file which i have just edited
5:52:57
i will click on upload it's done you don't get exactly the
5:53:04
message it's done but but it's done and how will you test it i i did it from problem uh a
5:53:11
problem list but i will go to incident and you will see the magic
5:53:16
you will see the magic and if i sort this out
5:53:24
there is my incident
5:53:34
let me do it all maybe let me search with import
5:53:42
yep see this is the same incident which we exported and you can see the
5:53:49
data here now this is a demo uh for importing data
5:53:55
now i'm not saying that now why exactly we use this some time because you use it
5:54:01
because sometime you make those changes for the same table you make those changes in different lower instances
5:54:08
and then you can import that data into your different environments like maybe production your
5:54:14
uat uh or different environments dev instance or sandbox instance other instances you have that's what you can
5:54:21
import data into different instances so if you have done if you have made any changes in one of the lower environment
5:54:28
and you want to replicate those changes into other instances as well this is how you can do that but as i mentioned you
5:54:36
should be a developer or administrator overall you should be an admin then you can do this feature
5:54:43
let me show you this import set application which you were talking about
5:54:48
so if i go here into application navigator and here i type system
5:54:55
import so you just type i am you will get this application called system import sets
5:55:02
here you can see we have this like application and you have a lot of modules here so starting with load data
5:55:10
you have create transform app you can create transfer map manually so what i will do i will show you by importing
5:55:17
some data but before that i will i will just try to show you some modules that what exactly they are so starting with
5:55:23
like load data so if i click here you will see i can load that data into
5:55:28
service now now here is the one which basically creates that staging table
5:55:33
and load that data you can you can do from here then we have a create transform map so
5:55:41
as i was talking about you have to match the fields in that case you can
5:55:46
create that transform app from here so you can create new or while you will work on the load data if you will
5:55:52
continue to do that you can also do it automatically that is something you can do it will automatically follow the same
5:55:58
process then you have run transform now in order to load the data you have to
5:56:04
import the data and then push that data into this table then you have to click
5:56:10
on this run transform this will run the transform but as of now it is asking that create load and import set first
5:56:16
which we have not created yet then you have some like one administration section here you click on
5:56:23
data sources which i was talking about that is one of the component here you can define different data sources
5:56:30
so for example i can i can show you let's say we have this uh cs3 maybe ldap users so here you have uh
5:56:38
example ldap users now this will be directly connected to the ldap that's one of the source you
5:56:44
have so i can i can just go back so these are the examples you can also have
5:56:50
some attachments as well if i see you have any um csv maybe or or maybe any other i
5:56:57
think i don't i don't think we have any other example where i can show you the attachment but that's okay let's let me
5:57:04
show open this one i think this is something related to the ftp server so you your company must have
5:57:11
sftp server and you can do that this will be done with the help of mid server but that is something you can do as well
5:57:19
so uh then this is about data sources so you can have multiple data sources then you have robust import trends
5:57:26
transformers that means you can you can mention the i think this is the something which i think came later this was not
5:57:33
before in the in the past uh you can have the robust import set transformers that is
5:57:39
something you can create here then we have etl definitions i think here you can define some
5:57:45
definitions then we have transform maps now whatever transform maps you will be creating
5:57:50
overall you create data source you create import set table you also create transform map for each transformation
5:57:57
you do you always create a new uh transform map but it is just one time for a particular activity that is
5:58:03
something you can do then we have a schedule import so you can that's a good thing so if you have
5:58:10
any kind of data source where data is always available maybe every day or or every every six hours or so in that case
5:58:18
you can schedule the inputs that means a system will automatically run the job it will try to import the data which
5:58:25
that source has and just put it into the system that is how that scheduling works overall you can import the data by
5:58:32
schedules as well frequently as well then you have advanced option here advanced section where you can see all
5:58:39
the import sets now every every data being imported into
5:58:44
service now where this import sets functionality it it is always being tracked when i say tracked it creates a
5:58:51
number it creates a record and shows you all the details about that particular import whether it was success it was
5:58:58
fails it got some errors that is something you can see in import sets so whenever if you're getting any
5:59:04
functionality if you're getting any data into service now into into uh into via import sets in that
5:59:10
case you you can always go here and check if anything is failing or everything is passing that is something
5:59:16
you can see here and you can try to troubleshoot for any data issues you will get
5:59:21
then we have concurrent that means it can be like concurrent uh import sets
5:59:26
you have concurrent uh imports it's job as well these are some functionalities which servers now came up uh not not i
5:59:33
would say recently but yeah they came up later which was not i think in the beginning
5:59:38
when they started with this application then we have progress here you can see
5:59:44
the progress of your import that is something you can see you can see transform history that if while
5:59:50
transforming the data did you get any issues how many data got inserted updates ignored skipped that's how
5:59:57
you can see here run time completed state when exactly it got started that is something you can see here then we
6:00:04
have transform error so if you will get any errors in during your import you can see here which what target record what
6:00:11
was the issue that is how you can see so that you can troubleshoot and you will i'm sure in your organization if you
6:00:18
will be importing the data i am 100 sure that you might get a lot of issues while
6:00:23
importing the data until unless you are maybe playing safe from the beginning
6:00:28
but sometimes i think it happens because you have a lot of data so sometimes you forget some some kind of prerequisite or
6:00:35
preview checks which you have to do as a developer or administrator but that's still okay it's not something
6:00:41
end of the world you can you can just try to troubleshoot those issues and just fix
6:00:47
them and that's it then you have import log here you will find the import log import logs
6:00:53
basically we can uh delete them so you can see we can cleaning import sets here
6:00:58
it kind of run a job and it clears the old imports because we don't need these data it it it does not need for us like
6:01:06
we don't need this kind of data to keep the import logs maybe max seven days or maybe
6:01:12
ten days or so so you can change this days but as of now it's just seven days
6:01:18
uh then we have if i go little bottom here we have another section import sets table so whenever you will
6:01:24
create a new import set table it will automatically be added and shown here in this particular module so here you have
6:01:32
import sets table so whatever imports that stable you have in your system you can see here
6:01:38
imports table i have a cleanup as i mentioned you will you will get a cleanup um then we have schedule cleanup as well
6:01:45
you can you can schedule those cleanups that every maybe seven all the data before seven days should be
6:01:52
deleted that is something you can schedule here so let me let me do one thing let me
6:01:57
show you an example by importing some data into service now so that you will understand the whole
6:02:04
process practically because that is important i can show you the ppt but it's it's better to show you practically
6:02:11
in the system so you so that you will have right understanding so what i will do i will start with creating an excel
6:02:18
sheet first let's say example because that's that's the best example i can show you because i don't have any kind
6:02:23
of ftp source i don't have any kind of maybe jdbc connection right now or any
6:02:28
other network file server i can just show you with the help of excel format so let me create some data
6:02:35
and then we will see how exactly you will be importing that data into servicenow
6:02:41
here is my excel sheet now before putting that data before creating that data what i will do we
6:02:47
will first select the table in which table we will import this data so i don't want to uh import that data into
6:02:54
servicenow incident or change or problem table we will we will try to import this data
6:03:00
into into custom table we created so let's let's go here and let's check we
6:03:05
had this table if you remember um i think we we created this table demo
6:03:11
acl second this one so we will try to import that data into this table that is
6:03:16
something we can do so if i go to table and uh if i say i had i think these two
6:03:24
uh fields right what i will do i will also create a number field because i want to show you the colleagues so if i
6:03:31
do auto number i have this acl table so
6:03:37
i think yeah that that's it for now i will save this
6:03:44
when i will once i will save this i think i will have that number column
6:03:51
as well so if i go here you can see that number column got added automatically
6:03:57
now we will have this test one so i will also see these two maybe column name column
6:04:05
name yeah we will we will import uh we will just select this field to be available on this view
6:04:11
so we have these three fields what i will do i will just go here
6:04:17
and i will try to um try to put some columns and data so maybe here i will i will mention
6:04:24
um a string and that's that's see i'm just putting any column name
6:04:29
maybe string one and here i'm putting a string
6:04:37
two that is what i am putting right here so maybe you're not
6:04:43
able to see so let me just increase the zoom it so that you can
6:04:49
see that so in that case i have a string
6:04:54
one string two as of now what i will do i will just put some data
6:05:00
so maybe this is uh maybe just like this i will i will do
6:05:06
uh import one now this is the data i'm putting here so
6:05:11
i will do import one
6:05:16
data one and here import two so that we can recognize whether this
6:05:23
data and what it wasn't inserted or updated into the same uh fields
6:05:29
so we have this import tool now because as of now that table i think just has one or two records
6:05:34
so in that case what i will do i will save this
6:05:40
i will give it a random name
6:05:48
so i will give it as maybe a demo demo
6:05:54
for import so when you do a demo for import format
6:06:01
is excel um we will make it on desktop that is okay and i will click on save
6:06:07
now so my this excel sheet is saved now what i will do i will go to my
6:06:14
instance here is my instance now in order to import the data what i
6:06:20
will do i will go to system import sets so here i have load data so first i will
6:06:27
click on load data because i have to first import that data
6:06:33
load it into service now staging table first so here i will select this create table
6:06:39
you can select the name as well here so maybe i will do demo
6:06:44
demo for import that's a table name we are
6:06:50
selecting here i will select the file because i don't have any other data source where i will select the file i
6:06:56
will select the file directly from my local system
6:07:01
so i will go to desktop and here i have that file so i have this demo for import and
6:07:09
then i will just click on submit so it says sheet number one header row one so
6:07:14
in that case that means header row that's a one row where you can define where exactly which one is your header
6:07:20
row that is something you can define here and just click on submit
6:07:25
once you would click on submit now the import process has started so what it
6:07:31
will do it will first process it and create that table for you so you can see it says complete we have been able to
6:07:40
import that data into staging table successfully so that says complete success and here i have process two it
6:07:47
says inserts to the we have two records overall and that's true we had two records now the
6:07:53
next thing we have to do is create transform map that's a next step so you can see here it says next steps
6:08:00
so what i will do because as of now this data is not aware and which is the target table we don't know as of now
6:08:06
system does not know about like as a user as an administrator you know about it but system does not know so in that
6:08:13
case i will click on create transform map now here you are going to map those fields you are going to make those
6:08:19
relationships in that case what i will do here i will just do demo um i think
6:08:24
we will we can give the name as demo for import
6:08:30
that's it that's our transform map name so because that's also kind of another record here
6:08:35
are some details like active you can just run business rules when importing the data do you want to run the business
6:08:41
rule that is something you can do and first mandatory fields if you want to do that you can do here copy empty if there
6:08:48
is a field empty you still want to copy you can check this box create new record on empty college fields means if
6:08:55
coalition but as of now we have not selected the coalition i will show you what is the utilization of colase in
6:09:02
that case what i will do i will just go to target table here i will select the target table we are talking about in
6:09:08
that case that table is acl i think we had acl demo second so i will
6:09:14
select that one and i will click on before clicking on submit now here is the deal you have to
6:09:22
do auto map matchings i think auto map matchings will not work here we have to
6:09:27
go to uh mapping assist so in that case i will click on mapping assist
6:09:33
so before creating that transform map i'm going to mapping a system these are the fields for target table we have
6:09:40
where we can put the data now this is something we got from our staging table
6:09:46
and the fields which we got from our our excel sheet those are you will see here
6:09:52
i'm sure uh here we have a string one we have a string two
6:09:57
you can see we have a string two and that's it we had two columns in that
6:10:02
extra sheet so in that case i will do one thing i will map this to test one
6:10:08
and then let's do test two that's it we are not going to put number numbers should come automatically
6:10:14
because that's a numbering it should come automatically so what i will do i will click on save
6:10:20
we're done with mapping right now relationship is done transfer map is also done so you can see i have mapped
6:10:27
those fields it will show you as of now nothing is colace even even the number
6:10:33
is not coalesce yet you can do that mapping if you want but you should have that data into your
6:10:39
excel sheet so as of now i'm not going to do that what i will do i will just
6:10:44
check so i will i will just click on transform now because i'm done with i'm done with table transform map creation
6:10:51
mapping assist now i have to transform this data into the actual table so in
6:10:56
that case what i will do i will click on transform it will show me the processing now here
6:11:02
it will ask me ask me which transform map you want to select in that case it will auto select the transform map which
6:11:08
we have to run so i will just click on transform map and here is the i set
6:11:14
basically import set so i will click on transform and it's done it says success complete
6:11:22
and if i go here here's the import set log you can see it says two inserts
6:11:29
so two records were inserted no updates nothing ignored nothing escaped no errors so that means
6:11:35
two records were inserted how exactly i can cross check it i can just go to the
6:11:40
same table if i go here you can see we got import one we got import two we got data one we
6:11:48
got data two these are the two records which you had in that excel sheet now
6:11:53
let's let's let's understand about colase that how coleus would work here so in that case
6:11:59
what i will do i will first add the number uh number field here
6:12:05
number column so you can see the first record because it was created long back that's the reason we didn't
6:12:11
have numbering at that point of time because we enabled numbering today and now we have those numberings
6:12:16
automatically now what happens if i uh put those numbers in in this in the
6:12:22
excel file which i'm importing what would happen so here you will learn about the colas fields so what i will do
6:12:29
i will just put these records maybe so maybe acl this i will just copy this
6:12:36
number and i will go to my excel sheet here i have i will just type
6:12:42
numbering not number i will type numbering
6:12:48
and import uh two i will just uh mention that particular
6:12:54
so i will so i will copy that
6:13:01
so i have this number field here and then i have this
6:13:08
one
6:13:15
match destination formatting okay it's done so our excel sheet is ready i will
6:13:20
save this what do you think if i will import this data
6:13:25
will it create new records or will it update those records
6:13:31
so let's take a look so i go here i go to
6:13:36
system import sets
6:13:41
here i have load data do i need to create
6:13:46
a new table so the answer is no because we have already created that table so i will just go to existing
6:13:53
and i will select that table and that table will create demo for import i will keep selecting the file
6:14:00
i will select my file here and submit it
6:14:05
i will click on submit you can see it says two inserts that's okay that that's still staging table so it has to im i
6:14:13
think insert that data first then i will run the transform now you do you need to
6:14:18
create transfer map answer is no the reason behind it because as of now we we
6:14:24
don't need to map anything basically your transform map was already created but there is one
6:14:30
one tweak here because as of now that transform app doesn't have that uh
6:14:36
number field mapping that that that you don't have as of now so let's say i will
6:14:41
just click on run if you will click on run
6:14:47
it will insert that data so i will come here and i will click on transform
6:14:53
that is done and if i come here it inserted two records and if i go to
6:14:59
cell service we will open it in a new tab
6:15:09
you can see two more rackets were inserted but this time you can see
6:15:14
numbering was done automatically but you mentioned those two numbering in the
6:15:21
same in the same rackets the two rows you have so ideally you want them to update not
6:15:28
insert so in that case what you need to do you have to put the colase in your transform
6:15:33
map how can you do that because you have already created your transform map in that case just go to your application
6:15:40
again so you go to system [Music] import
6:15:45
here you have transform maps the one you just created let's see that
6:15:53
here is the one open this
6:15:59
go to mapping assist you have to match that number as well so
6:16:07
this time you should have that numbering we have this numbering
6:16:14
so do you want to match it so i will say yes i will say here basically no because
6:16:20
we don't want to match that numbering or or we want it so i think we should map it so i will just
6:16:27
match it and i will save this
6:16:34
in that case even if you have matched it and if i import the data it will still insert the rackets do you
6:16:41
want to see it let's do that again because that's i think that's how it will give you better understanding maybe let's say i'm
6:16:46
changing this to data three let's say i'm just doing it as
6:16:52
data 3 and here as well i'm changing it as data import 3. just to
6:16:59
show you so let's see if if it imports the data updates the data or insert the data so
6:17:05
in that case i will go again to load data here i will select existing table demo
6:17:11
for a second that's already selected i will go to demo for import submit
6:17:18
go to run transform you can see two were inserted so it captured those two records now it is
6:17:26
already selected i will click on transform it will transform the data and if i come here it has inserted again and
6:17:34
if i come here and refresh this let's see yep you got six records now so it is
6:17:40
still not updating it how it will update it let me show you so in this case i
6:17:46
will come here and i will go to my transform maps
6:17:53
open open my transform map which i just created
6:17:58
and i will go here now here you have this field mapping and you can you can define the colleagues field now
6:18:07
this is this is a really important selection as a developer or administrator because you have to define coalits field
6:18:14
which is really you want to make sure that that data you want to update always
6:18:20
so in that case numbering is the one which you definitely don't want to insert new right because if it's the
6:18:26
same numbering is the same in that case it should not insert new racket it should update the same racket so in that
6:18:32
case what i will do i will just double click on it and i will make it coalesce that's it
6:18:39
you're done it is done so you will see the difference of the behavior now
6:18:45
so if i go to my excel sheet here so you have these two records
6:18:51
so what i will do i will again save it i think we didn't change it so let it be like this i think we can just click on save if
6:18:58
nothing got changed i will go back to my instance here and this time i will click
6:19:04
on load data you will see the difference and but before that i think let's let's
6:19:11
change the data let's make it import four so that we will see that only these
6:19:18
two rackets will be changed in your instance so we have made it uh import for data for i have saved it
6:19:25
i'm going back to my instance let's keep selecting it click on choose file i will select my file
6:19:32
and i will just okay i already selected okay no file chosen i will select my
6:19:38
file selected i will click on submit now
6:19:44
you can see because in staging table it will always say insert because i don't think it would update it
6:19:50
until until that that particular racket is there so but that's okay you can click on run transform now
6:19:57
if i run transform now you will see that difference and i click on transform
6:20:04
it is success and if i go to my import sets here is the difference
6:20:10
you can see total was two that means it did some two activity two records but it was not insert it was
6:20:18
update so if i go to this list and if i refresh this you will see that i refresh
6:20:26
this and you will see the data change here import for data for for these two
6:20:33
records which were in their access sheet and they were also mentioned as cola's fields in this system
6:20:41
so that's how that's how you can you can define collis fields and make sure that
6:20:47
you are updating the rackets it's totally depend on your business case your use case your requirement from your
6:20:53
customer but that is how you can define and that's what corey's field is is a
6:20:58
very i would say very critical functionality of importing data into servicenow system
6:21:07
let's talk about another functionality that is data policy
6:21:12
as of now we have not talked about ui policy because data policy is somehow related to ui policy as well ui policy
6:21:21
is something you can put something on the ui and data policy is something that same thing will can be applied into into
6:21:28
uh data when data is being basically imported now it might happen that you might want to put some kind of
6:21:36
mandatory checks that this particular field is mandatory in that case you do not want that data
6:21:42
to be inserted or updated that means that field should not be
6:21:48
blank so in that case what i will do we have this particular table so what i will do i will create a
6:21:55
data policy for for this particular table first so maybe i will go to data
6:22:00
policy as of now i don't have any data policy for this uh this table so i will click
6:22:07
on new so here is the data policy form
6:22:13
and i will just do make test one
6:22:19
mandatory so test one field will be mandatory now it will be at data level that means
6:22:27
nobody can insert the data even during import so in that case what i will do i will mention i think i
6:22:34
don't have to put any kind of condition i can just save this
6:22:40
and you can see we have these options here as well apply to import sets apply
6:22:45
to soap apply to ui policy as well that's how uh these uh
6:22:50
data policy works so yes we need to check this box so i think that's an important point in order to apply these
6:22:56
data policies you have to keep this check box checked that's very important so in that
6:23:02
case now i'm going to create that data policy uh the action what exactly the rule i need to apply so i will apply it
6:23:10
on one field that is the test one and i will make it mandatory so it is
6:23:17
mandatory true and i will click on submit so in that case if that data will not be
6:23:24
there in that field our data will not be imported so what i will do now i will go to my
6:23:32
excel sheet and i will just do like blank this data so maybe i
6:23:38
will i will keep one data and one not so string one
6:23:44
is the test one so maybe i will just cancel this one and here maybe i will
6:23:50
just do import import
6:23:56
data policy and here
6:24:04
and here i will not put anything and maybe i can just put here import
6:24:09
five and here i can put import
6:24:16
six maybe but you can see i'm i'm keeping this particular feed blank so let's see what
6:24:22
happens so i'm saving this i'm going back to my instance
6:24:28
i will go to load data now click on i think it's already selected i
6:24:34
think that's a good thing like it already uh i think uh keeps your last selection so i have this one now i will
6:24:42
click on choose file i will click on demo for import so the file which we
6:24:47
have i will click on submit it says two inserts that means i have two data that's okay i will click on run
6:24:55
transform let's see
6:25:00
then i will click on transform it's done it succeeded but let's see if
6:25:07
i click on transform here import sets it's it's total and it says zero and it
6:25:13
is skipped so here you got to skip
6:25:19
if you click here it says unable to resolve target call is
6:25:24
values not present you numbering so if i see my data
6:25:31
this is not available that means it is very important here so i think we we
6:25:36
forgot that i think it's it is saying that you have to have those colis
6:25:43
numbering so in that case what i will do i will remove this i want i won't put that
6:25:48
number because if you are putting that data then it will ask for that so what i'm doing i'm just closing this
6:25:55
i am going to i think this is really good if even if you are getting errors you you can just
6:26:01
learn new thing the why you are getting that error maybe i will just do it again i will go for it and i will click on
6:26:07
submit run transform
6:26:13
let's see what happens in this case and i will click on transform
6:26:18
success i will go here and it says again collis fields okay it
6:26:25
it it call it's values not present that means it is asking for but ideally it
6:26:31
should create those rackets it should not if if coley's fields are not there it should not let me let me check the
6:26:38
transform map then why it is why it is ignoring it why it is keep on
6:26:43
asking colleagues fields it says create new racket on callers i think that's
6:26:48
selection we forgot so i think you learned a new selection so college field is not indexed that's okay cancel for
6:26:55
now and here what i will do that that's a very important thing so coalesce field that means yes if coalesce field is not
6:27:02
there you want to insert the racket you can do that that's kind of mandatory thing you can also apply and so i can
6:27:08
just save this so once it is saved what i will do i will load it again
6:27:16
i will go here we have not done the indexing but it's it's it's really a best practice i would
6:27:21
say you should index as well i will select the file
6:27:26
again and i will click on submit
6:27:32
once i will click on submit let's see it has two inserts i will click on run transform and i will run the transform
6:27:38
again success and if i go here let's see what
6:27:43
happens import sets awesome so you can see
6:27:49
it it inserted one record but not the another one because it says data policy
6:27:56
exception where the field is mandatory now this is how you can utilize
6:28:02
data policy as well for importing the data so if you want users not to not to import some maybe uh
6:28:11
some junk data where you you have to you have to get mandatory fields in the system you can
6:28:18
write data policies into that table onto those fields so that you you are getting
6:28:25
right data into your actual service now tables so this was the whole whole session
6:28:32
about uh system import sets that how you can import data into servicenow so i
6:28:38
hope this will be really helpful for your organization for you to import data into servicenow with different with
6:28:45
different scenarios with different functionalities we have in service now
6:28:51
configuration management database that is cmdb
6:28:56
in this section we will learn about cmdb in service now cmdb tables and structure
6:29:03
ci and relationships ci dependency view and ci class manager
6:29:09
we will also try to just edit some or configure some configuration items in my
6:29:14
personal developer instance and we will also see that how exactly you can utilize cmdb items in different tasks or
6:29:23
records what is cmdb
6:29:30
cmdb is configuration management database it is a series of tables and fields
6:29:36
which stores information about configuration items managed by organizations
6:29:44
it also stores information about relationship between different ci's that
6:29:49
is configuration items
6:29:54
what is configuration item ci is a tangible or intangible device or
6:30:01
application in cmdb example computers servers
6:30:07
business service a database instance the laptop or computer you get from your
6:30:14
company it is a configuration item a server on which you work upon it is a
6:30:20
configuration item application you use in your organization that is a
6:30:26
configuration item cmdb application
6:30:33
service now has this out of the box application to manage cmdb that is
6:30:38
called configuration and you have a lot of modules under this
6:30:43
application which you can utilize to manage cmdb data in your organization
6:30:50
this is my personal developer instance you need to go to application navigator
6:30:56
and type configuration when you will type configuration and
6:31:02
just come little bit bottom you will see this application and that is the application where you can manage
6:31:08
your cmdb it has various modules as you can see here
6:31:14
like ci class manager cmdb groups cmdb quality builder
6:31:20
lot of modules are there to manage your cmdb data
6:31:26
ci form a ci record contain information about a
6:31:32
ci the first field we have is name
6:31:37
that is the name of the ci the configuration item you have you will
6:31:43
mention the name over here then you have asset tag it's kind of a
6:31:48
unique tag for all cis you have in your organization
6:31:54
then we have manufacturer which shows the company who has manufactured that particular ci
6:32:04
then you have asset here you mentioned the associated asset you have in your asset management table
6:32:11
where you track all your assets that's what you can mention here
6:32:17
then you have class now this is something that which class the ci belongs to that is something you can
6:32:24
define here then you have company
6:32:30
the company is something that which customer has this particular ci
6:32:36
then you have serial number model id and then assign to which is kind of a primary person
6:32:43
responsible for this particular ci
6:32:49
then we have comments if you want to provide any kind of comments you can mention here for this
6:32:56
particular ci then we have configurations so this
6:33:01
section shows the configuration of that ci and you can see different fields we have like host name os domain operating
6:33:09
system os service desk dns domain ip address these are the configuration of a
6:33:14
particular device that is something you can define here all the configuration you have for a particular ci that can be
6:33:21
defined here and the next section we have is related
6:33:26
items now in this section you can see the related items that means all those ci's which are related to this
6:33:33
particular ci you can see in this particular section
6:33:42
ci dashboard view you can also see more details about a ci
6:33:47
via dashboard view it shows that how much healthy your ci is as per the metrics defined
6:33:54
related ci and tasks associated with the ci as well are shown you can see like we
6:34:00
have and exactly some changes were happened you have completeness you have compliance correctness
6:34:06
is the ci stale that means it has stale data uh it was not updated maybe uh within a specific time it has some
6:34:13
relationships as well you can see it shares relationship formatters uh then you have the bottom you see it says
6:34:18
change incident tasks that whatever tasks associated with the ci that you can see the list here as well
6:34:28
key cmdb tables so cmdb has three key tables
6:34:36
the first table is base configuration item which is the main parent table of whole
6:34:42
cmdb then we have configuration item
6:34:48
which is extended from base configuration item
6:34:53
and then the third main table we have is ci relationship
6:34:59
which stores data related to the relationship between different ci records
6:35:07
cmdb table hierarchy so let's understand that how
6:35:13
cmdb tables are structured the base main table of cmdb is
6:35:20
base configuration item which extends another table that is
6:35:25
configuration item so that is also one of the base table and then we have tables like hardware
6:35:33
or application and there are many other applications or tables you have which
6:35:40
are also called as cmdb classes now these classes extend other ci
6:35:46
classes like you have computer and for application you have application
6:35:53
server you can extend like there are different classes there are different extended
6:35:59
classes as per the i think categorization you have for that particular uh ci that's that's how you
6:36:06
divide you categorize these classes into into into different categorizations so
6:36:12
that you can have profit defined classes as part of cmdb in service now
6:36:18
usage of cmdb when you have proper cmdb ci's in
6:36:23
service now then you can use these configuration items for the creation of different
6:36:29
records like incident problem request
6:36:36
that means these particular items they are related to configuration
6:36:41
items these all records these tasks which we are talking about incident change problem or request they are
6:36:47
related to configuration items that is something you can define how exactly you
6:36:52
can define so you can see on incident form in which ci is selected
6:37:00
which means there is an issue related to this particular ci now this helps agents and i.t users to
6:37:07
fix the issues effectively in the organization similarly you have configuration item on
6:37:15
problem form and you have configuration item to be selected on change form as
6:37:20
well ci dependency view
6:37:26
dependency view display graphical infrastructure view of a ci and all
6:37:31
others ci connect or related to the ci it also indicates if there is some
6:37:38
existing issue or alert for a ci so when you see the dependency view it
6:37:43
shows you the graphical infrastructure view where you can see that one particular ci
6:37:49
is connected to different ci's if there is a connection and you can see that if there is some
6:37:54
issue existing issue in a particular ci now how this dci dependency view will be
6:38:01
used in in real real world so for example if you have an application
6:38:08
it is it is down now that application might have some up streams maybe it should have some
6:38:13
downstreams so in that case one of the upstream will be downstream
6:38:20
they're getting some data maybe upstream application maybe they have some issues
6:38:25
so how would you see that you can see that in this particular view
6:38:30
that what all connection connected applications are impacted as of now
6:38:36
maybe there is a server impacted maybe there's a multiple issues for a server maybe application server is impacted
6:38:43
or any any database instance is impacted that is something you can see here in dependency view
6:38:53
next is ci class manager ci class manager displays the entire ci
6:38:59
class available in the instance in hierarchical structure like tree
6:39:05
showing all ci class definitions in one place so whatever classes you have so
6:39:10
whenever you define different classes that is something you can see in ci class manager you can manage as
6:39:16
well and that's what it says it is easier way to view modify or extend a
6:39:22
cia class that's an easier way to to provide if you want to modify your
6:39:27
classes that is something you can do in via cia class manager
6:39:33
and it is really helpful so let's see all these elements which we
6:39:38
talked about in my personal developer instance
6:39:44
let me show you that how you can utilize cmdb and what is the usage of cmdb
6:39:50
so if i go to incident application under incident application if i click on
6:39:56
create new and i try to create a new incident
6:40:01
so when i when i try to create a new incident it will ask me two information here
6:40:07
one is service and configuration item as of now this is not mandatory however
6:40:13
in organizations when you implement incident management i think configuration item should always be
6:40:20
mandatory but not for end users because end users they don't know what kind of
6:40:25
configuration item it is but if i talk about it users it should be mandatory
6:40:31
so in that case here is the field we have configuration item and another field we have service now both the
6:40:38
fields they are targeting two cmdb tables cmdb classes however
6:40:43
configuration item shows all the configuration items you have in your instance so if i click on that
6:40:50
search icon you can see these are the all configuration items regardless of the classes that mean it shows all the
6:40:57
classes i can select any computer i can select any server software everything i can select so
6:41:03
let's say there is an issue maybe i have this app cast client i have an issue with this particular software so in that
6:41:10
case i can just type this down and i can say appcast is not working it is an
6:41:16
issue because if i will just create a random incident for example if i'm not using i'm just i'm just removing this
6:41:23
from here and i'm just putting any name here let's select any random name
6:41:31
and if i just click on save in this case whomsoever person will get
6:41:37
this incident he will not be able to identify and he will not be able to get more details so it's really important
6:41:43
you have to select that which configuration item is impacted because i think this would be really useful for
6:41:50
everything for reporting purpose i i know you can still mention in short description but if i ask that how how
6:41:57
how many tickets you got for this particular ci that is how you can get it from here maybe it might happen and
6:42:03
that's what you do in service now with the help of ci whenever i select any ci
6:42:09
it gets assigned to the primary group maybe that that lot of organizations they do that so in that case
6:42:15
if i will just mention the application name in short description in that case i won't be able to reroute it or route it
6:42:21
automatically but if i will select configuration item and that application will be available here i select it and
6:42:28
incident will be automatically routed that is also you can kind of implement in your service now instance and i think
6:42:33
servicenow also provides that kind of feature out of the box but as of now i think it's not enabled you have to you
6:42:39
have to apply that feature but servicenow if you if you will go to servicenow documentation you will find
6:42:45
that feature so as i mentioned here you have a configuration item so i can select that
6:42:51
application that configuration item so it can be a server it can be an application whatever classes we have now
6:42:57
what are those different classes we have so if i go to configuration item let's
6:43:02
let's say configuration so i go to configuration application and if i go to let's say from here
6:43:10
application now these are all applications overall this is definitely extending from cmdb so you can see these are all
6:43:18
applications you have so if i right click and see the table let's see
6:43:23
which table it is so it should be a cmdb uh application table so you can see it's a application
6:43:29
table however it is extending from configuration item that means it is one
6:43:35
of the class you have in your instance that is application and you can create
6:43:40
different applications if i click here you will see these are the applications we have if i go little bit bottom you
6:43:46
will see different categories like you can have application servers you can have servers clusters database i think
6:43:53
different category of devices you have in the organization or in the whole world i think that which is used in
6:44:00
different organizations that is what service now has provided you those classes those categorizations out of the
6:44:06
box i think directly from servicenow you don't have to create it but it might
6:44:11
happen as part of your implementation in your organization sometimes organizations they you they do use their
6:44:18
own classes custom classes so that's totally up to you what is recommended what is not i'm not going to tell you in
6:44:24
this particular session because it's just about the glimpse of cmdb so here you can see we have this like all all
6:44:32
database catalogs you have you have network devices like networks services you have load balancers data centers
6:44:39
infrastructure services as well like email ftp these are all different classes you have and their data
6:44:47
and you can define you can mention these these configuration items in different records as i mentioned like incident
6:44:53
change problem now let me open one of the configuration item maybe let me open
6:44:59
this one alternate smtp it is kind of a
6:45:04
ip service or maybe let me open uh really i think which will have more fields maybe so i will open maybe a
6:45:12
server let's let me open a server so we have this windows server so i'm opening this over
6:45:19
windows server let me check what all details it has
6:45:25
yep it's opens okay so you can see these are the details which we were talking about like name as a tag all the
6:45:32
configuration how much ram is there on this server uh cpu speed uh what kind of
6:45:37
operating system so that is the configuration you can see here you have related items now if you
6:45:42
before that i showed you two views one is the form view this is the one and then you have dashboard view in
6:45:48
dashboard view you can see different details more details about the health check of this particular ci whether your
6:45:55
ci is healthy is there any relationships formatter do you have any stale data any
6:46:02
compliance is there completeness relationship any tasks you can see we have a lot of
6:46:07
these change records we have i think no no incident records if i click on task you will get me with these
6:46:14
tasks these sir records as well so how many how many records are associated
6:46:20
with this configuration item that is something you can see here so if i open this again
6:46:27
and so here we have related items you can see the different items which are
6:46:33
related to this now these are also cis like you can see receives data from mass storage devices here you have vm sd4 now
6:46:41
this should be a ci if i click on it you will see this will open a cmdbci server it's kind of it's another server you
6:46:48
have with the same similar kind of details like assat and asset tag
6:46:53
manufacturer company configurations um it is again showing that which items
6:46:59
are related to this particular that's how you define that what items are related to what other different ci that
6:47:06
means configuration items now if you have any new relationship if you have if
6:47:12
you want to add in that case you can just click on this plus button you will see this new screen which says
6:47:19
relationship editor that means you can add different items into your configuration items and add their
6:47:25
relationships so in this case if i select anyone for example it says
6:47:31
used by child it is one of the suggested relationship and that's how servicenow is suggesting you that you can utilize
6:47:37
these relationships for your adding different relationship with the different configuration items so if i
6:47:43
select this one and if i go little bit bottom you will see these are the configuration items and we have these
6:47:48
existing relationships so in that case i can select maybe this one this one this one this one and then i will just click
6:47:56
on plus icon after selecting these configuration items i will click on
6:48:01
plus what you will see it will be added here you can see that these items are added
6:48:07
here and says used by child and these are added here if i click on save and
6:48:13
exit yes i want to okay if i do that
6:48:18
let's see what happens when i added that relationship you will
6:48:24
see that these five items are added now used by computers so i added those ci's
6:48:31
and it can be seen here so this is how you can add relationships manually now this is
6:48:37
something you can do automatically as well by pushing the data directly into ci relationship table so if i go to uh
6:48:45
configuration i think let me go to configuration and if you go a little bit bottom
6:48:52
you will you will see that relationships module we have
6:48:57
here you have relationships you also have suggested relationships so if you want to create a new relationship you
6:49:04
can also create it from here so for example if i click here you can mention that in what what kind
6:49:11
of base class the reason for suggested relationship is that like
6:49:16
for example uh an application it it cannot be uh maybe it cannot be
6:49:21
associated with a maybe maybe directly uh with with the with any uh database instance i'm just
6:49:28
giving example that it cannot be associated maybe maybe a firewall cannot be connected to a to a router
6:49:35
just i think it will be connected in in real world but i'm just giving example that if that's the reason suggested
6:49:41
relationships are really important because you don't want those kind of relationships to be to be misused i
6:49:48
would say that means for a particular ci class what kind of relationships you
6:49:53
should use that is how you can define for your organization so any any uh any
6:49:58
person who wants to create different ci relationships they should create those relationships with different
6:50:05
configuration items as per the suggested as per the recommended ci relationships
6:50:10
and that's how you can create these suggested relationships and you can use them as part of adding relationships in
6:50:17
in cmdb so that's how you can configure just a high level high level
6:50:24
details about cmdb that how exactly you can utilize cmdb relationships
6:50:30
one more thing i think we were just talking about uh dependency view so i will quickly show you that as well
6:50:37
so if i go back uh maybe i'll just open that servers
6:50:43
just one server maybe uh maybe this one so if i go a little bit bottom in in
6:50:50
related items if i show you here if i uh click this button called show dependency
6:50:57
views if you click this button it will show the dependency view that means this application is associated
6:51:03
with what different configuration items that is what you can see in this particular view
6:51:10
it is loading dependency view you can see as of now i i don't think it
6:51:15
is it has any any relationship even if i if i go here you can see it is blank
6:51:21
maybe let me let me go to another server so that you can understand better maybe we will select
6:51:28
the same ci which we had this one so you remember we
6:51:33
added these relationships with these configuration items so i will click on this dependency view
6:51:41
it is loading dependency view now and you can see now it is showing you that relationship that graphical
6:51:47
representation that how different servers how different services how different configuration items are
6:51:54
related to this particular server which we have just opened you can see that and where exactly it is
6:52:00
it is located that is something you can see here it is here windows server and
6:52:06
these are all like used by because that was the dependency used by that means this particular windows server is used
6:52:13
by these particular computers that is what you can mention here and these are the servers associated with this windows
6:52:20
server that is something you can see it's really a great view now one more important thing which i was talking
6:52:25
about that you can also see the issues some alerts now you can see some icons
6:52:31
here like if this particular ci or maybe in this view if you have any associated
6:52:37
ci with your primary ci which you're looking for or maybe which is the impacted ci you can see if there is any
6:52:44
existing incident problem or any kind of maintenance available for that
6:52:49
particular ci so if i give you the actual example now for example your one
6:52:54
of the application is down so what you can do you can open the disk dependency view and you will see that
6:53:00
what all maybe database instances servers are connected are related to that particular application you might
6:53:07
find that your application is down and there are hell lot of incidents created
6:53:12
for a app for for one of the database instance maybe which is connected to this application application so in that
6:53:19
case you can just quickly check that in a check particular ci that means that database instance and check if the
6:53:25
incidents created their existing incident they're open they're active and they they and they are like they just
6:53:32
created they just got created recently when this application was down in that case you will get real and clear picture
6:53:39
that which element is impacted and that's a i would say the power
6:53:44
cmdb has it's a great i think it's a really powerful i would say powerful
6:53:49
application for any organization to use to identify issues to fix them to resolve them as soon as possible so this
6:53:57
is what this is what the glimpse of cmdb which you have to use in your
6:54:02

7:05:06
next topic is integration servicenow can share data with third-party applications or external
7:05:14
systems with integration some of the integrations which are used in servicenow are sso ldap monitoring
7:05:23
notifications events now what exactly we integrate in service
7:05:28
now common integrations are done with cmdb incident management
7:05:34
problem management change management user administration and single sign-on
7:05:39
which is used for login to servicenow platform you can use different ways for
7:05:46
integration like web services ldap excel email
7:05:53
these are different ways of integration with servicenow now we also have another great feature
7:05:59
in service now that is integration hub integration hub provides a single
7:06:05
solution to quickly integrate with third-party applications to share the data with servicenow or other system it
7:06:14
provides capability to perform integration without any coding as it
7:06:19
uses flow designer functionality each integration with different third-party applications like ms teams
7:06:27
google exchange xera is referred as a spoke
7:06:32
integration hub comes with license cost and has subscription packages as
7:06:37
standard professional and enterprise which gives access to different spokes
7:06:43
for integration enterprise package includes all spokes developed by servicenow
7:06:50
if you want to learn more about integration hub then you can refer servicenow documentation or learning
7:06:57
website this session is about servicenow update
7:07:02
sets as a developer or administrator
7:07:09
you must have done a lot of configurations or developments in service now now in order to
7:07:15
move those changes into different instances
7:07:21
you need update sets so let's start with the definition of
7:07:27
update set so what is an update set an update set is a group of
7:07:33
configuration changes that can be moved from one instance to another
7:07:39
this feature allows administrators to group a series of changes into a named
7:07:45
set and then move them as a unit to other systems for testing or deployment
7:07:53
if i give you a quick example that you want to perform some changes on
7:07:59
the form you add two fields on that form that means you have changed the layout of
7:08:05
that form at the same time you have also added a ui action a button on the form as well
7:08:14
now how exactly you can move these changes to the different instances
7:08:20
so in that case you can capture these changes that you have done in just one
7:08:25
unit and then you can move them into a different instance
7:08:30
now this particular unit which will have a name is an update set
7:08:37
update sets movement let's say you have instance one
7:08:43
so this is your maybe development instance and then you have instance two
7:08:49
this is your production instance now you have to move some changes that
7:08:55
means you have done some changes in this particular instance so you have change one change two change
7:09:02
three change four like i said form changes layout changes you have added a button you have created a client script
7:09:09
you have added a business rule four different changes but you have changed those uh
7:09:15
configuration the development in instance one now how this will be moved
7:09:21
so basically you will capture all these changes and these changes will be moved
7:09:27
to another instance with the help of update set
7:09:32
that means same change which you have in instance 1 will be replicated in instance 2 as well
7:09:43
update sets application in order to perform all these update
7:09:49
sets capturing a movement servicenow has a separate application
7:09:54
that is system update sets which has different modules
7:10:00
to manage these update sets let's take a look in my personal
7:10:05
developer instance in order to go to the application
7:10:12
you need to type system update
7:10:18
when you will type system update you will see this application
7:10:23
with some modules if i click on the first update sources so this is the first module
7:10:30
where you have to configure all your remote instances configurations
7:10:35
because you can only move the update sets the changes you will capture with the help of
7:10:41
update sets but those configuration has to be there so that it can know from where i have to pull the data i have to
7:10:48
pull the update sets changes in this instance then we have retrieved update sets
7:10:55
so basically this is like a primary instance or maybe a destination instance you can say
7:11:01
now this is like a production instance and you you're pulling some data from your dev or uat instance in that case
7:11:09
whatever changes you are pulling from your lower instances you can see here
7:11:15
then we have update log so whatever data whatever changes you
7:11:20
retrieve all all actions are being logged and you can see here
7:11:26
then you have local update sets so similarly in production as well
7:11:33
even you are pulling some data you are pulling some customizations from another instance
7:11:38
those are also being stay stayed here as a local update sets that means those
7:11:45
are the update sets for this particular instance so whatever changes you have in
7:11:50
form of update sets that you will find here then we have merge update sets so you
7:11:57
can also merge if you have different update sets and you want to merge them into one you can also do that service
7:12:03
now provides you that feature as well then you have merged completed update sets this already gives you
7:12:09
functionality that the update sets which are already completed you want to merge them you can just merge here
7:12:16
and then you have update sets to commit that means any update set you have to commit that means you have to install in
7:12:23
your this instance that you can see from this particular module
7:12:29
when to use update sets now this question is really important to
7:12:34
know but i will just explain you a little bit about update set
7:12:39
that whatever changes which are like development changes or configuration changes or should be
7:12:46
captured as a development they always gets captured in an update
7:12:51
set even you don't create anyone any any single update set
7:12:56
and that update set is basically default update set so service now automatically from the
7:13:03
beginning keep one update set even as in a fresh instance
7:13:09
i will quickly show you one instance which i just recently enabled this one
7:13:14
and if i will go to update set and i will click on local update sets
7:13:19
here you will only see one update set that is default
7:13:25
that means whatever changes you will be doing even directly on instance that will be captured in this
7:13:33
particular default update set now why servicenow does that because
7:13:38
just to make sure that you don't miss or or lose any kind of development or changes
7:13:45
you do in this instance and that's the reason service now automatically keep one update set that
7:13:52
is the default updates always in progress
7:13:59
the question here is when to use update sets so you should use update sets when the
7:14:05
changes you want to keep in every instance so baby you have different instances in
7:14:11
your organization and you want to keep those changes in every instance and you don't have to change it manually
7:14:18
so just an example you're writing a business rule in one instance now you don't want to write a business
7:14:24
rule again in production so you in order to make sure that all the business rules are being written in every instance for the same
7:14:31
functionality then you have to move it to every instance so then you need to use update sets
7:14:38
you have to use update sets when all the changes which can change the baseline and can give impact
7:14:44
so any change you want it can it can give impact it has to be done directly with the update
7:14:51
sets it should not be done directly in production the reason i mention here that why we need update sets
7:14:58
because you should not do these changes directly in production and that's the reason we have these
7:15:03
update sets so that you can do those changes in lower environment which is kind of a replica of production and then
7:15:09
you can move it to the different instances even in production and after testing as well and that's the
7:15:16
third point the changes needs to be tested in lower instance before moving to production
7:15:22
any kind of change maybe you are creating a business rule you can't directly create in production
7:15:28
because you know know whether that particular business rule will give any impact
7:15:34
so it's really better i think it's mandatory i would say that you perform that development into lower instances
7:15:41
move into different instances test it thoroughly and then move it to production
7:15:47
items captured in update sets so there are a lot of different items in
7:15:53
service now which are basically captured automatically so you don't have to do anything
7:16:00
manually to enforce them to be captured in update sets so items like
7:16:06
form configurations so whatever configuration on you do on form it does
7:16:11
capture in update sets related list configuration
7:16:17
business rules client scripts ui policy
7:16:22
ui actions notifications script includes ui pages
7:16:29
and more basically you can also change these these items in production
7:16:38
and that will also be captured in default update set however as i mentioned
7:16:43
you shouldn't do that so you have to create an update set indoor environment
7:16:48
capture these changes which i am showing you on the on the screen and then move them
7:16:54
but as i mentioned items captured in update set that means you don't have to do anything any extra activity you just go
7:17:01
into your lower instances create update set name it properly and then make it
7:17:07
current which we will see little bit later and once it is done you just perform the changes create a business rule create a
7:17:13
script include all those changes will be captured in that particular unit new unit which you just created
7:17:21
now items not captured in update set so that means there are some items as well in service now which you cannot be
7:17:28
captured which cannot be captured in update sets and those are task records
7:17:34
like you have records like incident change problem these records whatever changes you do in these records they
7:17:41
don't change they don't capture and update sets then we have users so you have user data
7:17:47
you do some changes in the users racket those doesn't change or just uh sorry those doesn't capture an update set
7:17:54
groups any rackets you have in groups table those doesn't capture in update sets
7:18:01
then you have schedule jobs schedule jobs as well even scheduled jobs are part of kind of
7:18:08
development but this they are still not captured but you can still do force capturing and
7:18:15
that's kind of a additional feature in servicenow that anything which is not captured and
7:18:21
you want to make it capturable in that case you can directly push it into an update set as well
7:18:30
cmdb rackets so all the cmdb repository we have it cannot be captured in update
7:18:36
set system properties and last i think it's just some more so
7:18:42
extractor a lot of other things um which we talked that a lot of things can be captured a lot of things cannot
7:18:49
be captured in update sets update sets planning process
7:18:55
now before you before you start moving the update sets
7:19:01
you have to make sure for some of the points that means you have to plan your moving
7:19:06
of the update sets properly so that you don't get any kind of issues
7:19:12
starting with same version instance that means when you are promoting the update sets
7:19:19
from instance 1 to instance 2 instance 1 and instance two should be on the same
7:19:25
servicenow version like madrid orlando new york
7:19:31
both the instances cannot be different because the reason behind it if you are performing a development in lower
7:19:38
instance maybe in madrid version and you are moving those changes into orlando things might break
7:19:44
so it's really it's kind of a mandatory i would say from servicenow that both the instances should be on the same
7:19:50
version then you have correct update set is selected as a developer or administrator when you
7:19:58
perform development or do any kind of changes which has been captured in update sets you have to make sure that right update
7:20:05
set is selected on on your on your development screen or in your service now in the same
7:20:11
session you're working on second thing is instance is third thing
7:20:17
is instance is cloned now you don't want that both the instances are on different maybe their
7:20:24
societies are different or some data is changed no or different in that case the best way is
7:20:31
you have to copy production to
7:20:37
lower instance and that's called cloning so you have to make sure that whenever
7:20:43
you do any kind of releases or maybe major releases your instances are keep on cloned
7:20:51
then we have identify path for update set movement now this is also important point in in
7:20:59
the planning process of update sets because when you have different
7:21:05
instances in your organization you might have dev you might have i t you have uat you
7:21:12
have you might have staging you might have production or maybe some temp instances or other
7:21:18
instances as well but you have to define a model a path that how your update sets will be
7:21:26
moved that means from instance 1 to instance two then instance three and then at last add in instance four
7:21:34
the next point we have is plan when to commit update sets in production now this is also really important
7:21:41
because production changes can also uh will also give you any kind of impact
7:21:47
or user may maybe get surprised why that new option got got added
7:21:53
so in that case you have to make sure that you are planning your movement of update sets in production properly
7:22:01
then we have clear naming convention that means whatever name you are
7:22:07
providing to your update sets while creating a new update set it should be pretty much understandable
7:22:13
if you're working in releases some sprints in your development life cycle for any mud module in that case you can define
7:22:20
some standard naming convention for your organization so that everybody every uh
7:22:25
developer can understand that naming convention preview and commit now you move the
7:22:32
changes you move the update set into different instances you have to make sure that you are properly previewing
7:22:37
them so that you can see what all errors or any kind of warnings are there you you fix those warnings and errors
7:22:44
and then after review that means you're reviewing it before moving as well so
7:22:49
when you are ready that yes i'm ready to move this update set you have to make sure that all the customizations which
7:22:55
you have done has been captured a lot of time is it has been seen the
7:23:01
developers sometimes forget to select the current update set the update set
7:23:06
which they they want current development to be captured so you have to make sure that you are
7:23:11
reviewing your update set you have proper customizations all the expected customizations and then only you are
7:23:18
moving to the different instance update set promotion
7:23:24
now how exactly update sets are being promoted in different instances
7:23:30
so we will start with dev instance so you perform the development in dev
7:23:36
instance any one of your dev instance and then you have uat instance
7:23:45
then you have a staging instance and then you have production
7:23:51
so dev is for development ui is for user acceptance testing staging is like a pre-broad instance and
7:23:58
then you have production instance main instance where all your business users
7:24:03
live users are working now you perform the development you capture the update sets in dev instance
7:24:11
and then you move that update set into uat instance now this was the identification of the
7:24:18
path so that you can perform the developmental production that means move the changes till production
7:24:26
then you perform the uat you perform the testing all your end
7:24:32
users perform the testing once everything is succeeded you move those changes to next instance that is the
7:24:38
staging now in staging you still do a one round of testing again
7:24:44
that if everything is good once those changes are being moved into
7:24:50
staging now you have a last stage that is production implementation
7:24:56
that means whenever you have planned for your production release if that date has come
7:25:02
then you will move all the changes from staging instance to production
7:25:08
instance
7:25:13
system update set tables we also have two different tables
7:25:20
for update sets one is update set the update racket which you create it's
7:25:27
a different table and that's table is says underscore update underscore set and that's update
7:25:33
set table where you add different customizations now all those customizations basically
7:25:40
which are captured maybe it's a form layout related list layout related list configuration adding a business rule all
7:25:47
those basically all data is an xml format so those are called customer update
7:25:55
so for each entry for each dictionary entry you have it creates it creates a customer update and then add into your
7:26:03
update set so basically customer update is a related list of updates set so when
7:26:10
you will open any update set you will see the related list customer update and you will see all the changes you have
7:26:16
done for any functionality you have changed events events are spatial log records that
7:26:24
system generate when something notable has happened or certain condition occur
7:26:30
like user logged into servicenow platform user approved the request
7:26:36
or any particular request is submitted now how these events are generated
7:26:43
events can be generated with business rules event queue scripting api
7:26:49
flow or workflows in business tools you can define trigger
7:26:54
condition which becomes an event like record updated inserted or deleted now you can
7:27:03
process that particular event which you are basically configuring when to run
7:27:08
you can basically configure actions as well it is just a configuration that is an
7:27:14
action which has to take when that particular condition is met that means that event is basically occurred
7:27:22
and you can also process that event with the help of action but that is also in scripting section that is an advanced
7:27:30
section where you can write the script now events can also be generated with
7:27:36
the help of scripting by using gs.event queue method
7:27:41
now this is something you can use if you want to generate any event in from your script it could be any server size
7:27:49
script you have you can and you want to generate that as an event and you have to take some action maybe in that case
7:27:56
you can use gs.even q if i give you a quick example maybe for notification
7:28:03
so if you're writing a server size script and you have to generate an event and that event
7:28:08
you have to use maybe notification you can use that in that case you can use gs.even q and you can provide all the
7:28:15
parameters like you have name name is the name of the event and how that name
7:28:21
basically come we will we will talk about that as well but then you have to provide the record which record you are
7:28:27
basically uh generating this event and then you have to provide parameters you
7:28:32
can provide two parameters parameter one parameter two and that is a string and then
7:28:37
if you want to use default queue then you don't have to mention any queue parameter but if you want to specify a
7:28:45
queue that means a dedicated queue for that particular event then you can specify the name of that particular
7:28:52
queue if you have any particular queue created in your platform
7:28:58
you can also generate an event in flow because in flow you have this trigger
7:29:03
section in trigger you can define you can configure whether record is created
7:29:09
updated if that particular event is triggered then you can perform any action
7:29:14
now you can also generate an event in workflow because in workflow you have an
7:29:20
activity that is called as create event you can mention that what event if any
7:29:26
action is being performed let's see your workflow is running and if on that workflow let's say there's one activity
7:29:32
is completed after that activity you want to generate an even to perform some action in that case you can add this
7:29:39
activity which is create event provide the details of the event and on the basis of that event you can perform some
7:29:46
action maybe you can send notification maybe you can run some other type of scripts it's totally up to you that how
7:29:53
as per the requirement you get from your customers what action you want to take on the when when that event is basically
7:29:59
occurred now event registry we were talking about specifying the
7:30:05
event that the name which will be generated which will be triggered in the system
7:30:12
and that is basically captured in event registry so if you have to
7:30:18
generate an event that even first have to be captured in event registry so you
7:30:24
have to go to the registry you have to create that event and you have to use the naming convention it's basically the
7:30:30
table name and then you can use any particular action let's say incident dot inserted
7:30:38
problem dot updated these are basically name of the events which you can specify in event
7:30:45
registry and then you can use that event name in workflow or you can also use in
7:30:51
gs.even q api and once you will mention that event it will be generated and then
7:30:57
you can perform any action as per the requirement you get from your customers
7:31:03
where exactly you can check that what kind of events are being generated so that section that module we have is
7:31:10
event log if you will go to event log under system policy you will find all
7:31:16
the events generated in your platform you can mention the filter created today
7:31:22
or any time basically it can monitor it capture all the events which are basically generated in the platform and
7:31:30
you can check when that particular event was triggered it's basically sometimes
7:31:35
used to troubleshoot as well because let's say you have written a script and it is generating an event and let's say
7:31:41
your whatever action you have mentioned it is not being triggered that action is not taken yet in that case you can go to
7:31:48
the script this event log and check whether that event was processed or not
7:31:54
so that's how you can troubleshoot by going to this event log section in event log module
7:32:01
event actions now once event is triggered you can also perform action like sending
7:32:09
notifications even in notifications you can select the event then actions
7:32:14
configured in business rule because ends record inserted is also an event so for
7:32:20
that in business tool you can perform any action maybe in action section we have in business tool or you can write a
7:32:27
script as well then you have action configured in flow so similarly like you
7:32:33
have in business rule flow also runs with the same concept because even even in flow you can define record inserted
7:32:40
created or updated and then you can perform any action and then last thing
7:32:45
is run a script because you also have a script action in in basically event module you have
7:32:53
this another module that is script action you can let's say if there is any event
7:32:59
generated and what kind of action you want to take with the help of script
7:33:04
then you can use script action but that's how you can use events and
7:33:10
you can generate different events as per the requirement you get from your customers
7:33:16
platform stats now servicenow provides a module stats
7:33:22
which basically provides statistics for system activities that affect performance such as execution of queries
7:33:30
scripts and transactions so if you will go to system diagnostic
7:33:35
you will see this module stats now this stats will also give you other
7:33:40
information like version of your servicenow instance like
7:33:45
you can see on the screen it also shows the cluster which is connected to it shows the build name san diego it shows
7:33:53
the exact version that is san diego patch one it shows the name of the instance and all
7:33:59
other instance all other information as well even the ip address whether instanced is online offline and other
7:34:06
likes uh server servlet memory that how many memory your your particular instance has
7:34:12
uh several statistics like how many transactions errors all those different
7:34:18
information so it's basically used for troubleshooting it's basically used to get the information about any instance
7:34:25
and if you want to know in any instance because you cannot basically recognize that what kind of instance is it it is
7:34:33
or what kind of version you have in basically uh for your platforms in that case any developer any administrator
7:34:40
would directly go to stats page which can show you all the relevant information uh where you can at least
