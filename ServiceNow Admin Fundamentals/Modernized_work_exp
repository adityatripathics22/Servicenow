--> How ServiceNow Works (Core Concept)

ServiceNow runs in the cloud

  Users access apps and data on any device (computer, tablet, phone).
  All data is stored in a database.

Data is organized as:

  Tables → contain

    Records (e.g., User record, Task record)
    Fields (data about that record)

Everything in ServiceNow = a record in a table

  Every element (users, incidents, tasks, etc.) is a record.
  Tables support the applications running on the platform.


--> Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS)

The “green box” mentioned refers to the ServiceNow platform, an application platform as a service.

Some tables are:

  Shared by multiple applications

  App-specific, used only by certain modules
    Example:
      ITSM uses Incident table
      HR uses HR Case table


--> How Users Interact

Users send requests to the server, and the server performs actions such as:

    Creating records
    Updating records
    Viewing analytics
    Retrieving data

This is the foundation of how ServiceNow applications operate.
