Topic: Manage Data – Tables, Records, Fields, Relationships, and Schema Map



1. Introduction

This module explains how ServiceNow organizes and manages data.
All information on the platform is stored using:
  Tables
  Records
  Fields
  Values

You will learn how tables relate to one another, how records are structured, and how schema maps help visualize data relationships.



2. Tables

Tables store records.
  Applications use tables to handle data and business processes (like Incident, CMDB, HR Case).
  Tables can extend other tables, forming parent-child relationships.
  The Tables & Columns module shows table structure, fields, and indexes.
  Dictionary entries hold table field definitions and properties.

Base Table
  A table that has no parent.
  Serves as the foundation for other tables.

Example:
  Task table is a base table.
  Incident, Problem, Change, etc. extend from it.

Child Table
  Inherits fields and properties from its parent table.
  Can also have its own unique fields.

Tables can be:
  Only a parent
  Only a child
  Both parent and child (depending on relationship)



3. Records
  A record is one row in a table.
  Each record has a unique 32-character sys_id.
  Record numbers can auto-increment.
  Formatting of record numbers can be changed in the Number Maintenance table.



4. Fields
  Fields hold individual pieces of data.
  Common examples include First Name, Last Name, Location, Category.
  Field labels and field names may differ:
    Field Label = what the user sees
    Field Name = unique system value stored in the database

Field values may also be empty depending on the business need.



5. Reference Fields
  Store the sys_id of a record from another table.
  Create a link between two tables.
  Allow data from the referenced table to be displayed.
  Only connect to a single table.
  Support wildcard searches.
  Example: The Caller field on the Incident table references the User table.

To reference a record from any table, the Document ID element is used.



6. Relationship Types

One-to-Many

A record on one table references a single record on another table.
Example: Caller on Incident links to a User table record.

GlideList

Allows selecting multiple records from another table.
Example: Watch List on Incident can include many users.

Document ID Field

Allows selecting records from any table in the system.

Many-to-Many

Used when multiple records from two tables need to be linked.
Example: Students and Classes
  A student can have many classes
  A class can have many students



7. Database Views
  Join tables together to create a read-only virtual table.
  Useful for reporting across multiple tables.
  Example: joining Incident with Metric tables.



8. Table Extensions

Tables can be:
  Brand new, or
  Created by extending an existing table.

When extending a table:
  Child inherits all fields and properties from parent.
  You can add unique fields on the child table.
  UI policies, mandatory indicators, and business rules are also inherited.

Example parent tables:
  Task
  Configuration Item

Child tables created from Task include:
  Change Request
  Incident
  Problem
  Request

Incident inherits fields like:
  Number
  Location

and then adds its own:
  Caller
  Category


9. Base vs Core Tables
  Base table: no parent, acts as starting point.
  Core tables: built-in ServiceNow tables.
  Custom tables: created by admins, can link to core tables through reference fields.

Custom tables are not part of the base system but can still interact with it.



10. Scoped vs Global Applications
  Scoped apps have restricted reach and API access to prevent platform damage.
  Global apps have full access and are the default scope.
  Scoped apps serve as a sandbox for safety and isolation.


11. Schema Map

The Schema Map shows:
  Table structure
  Parent and child relationships
  Fields and where they originate
  Extended and inherited properties
  Tables referenced by the current table

How to access:
  Open System Definition → Tables
  Select a table
  Click Show Schema Map under Related Links

In the example shown, Task is at the center, with tables like Problem and Change extending from it.

Schema Map shows:
  Which tables inherit fields
  Which fields are inherited
  Which tables are referenced

Tables marked with red bars are referenced tables.



12. Using Schema Map for Analysis
  Helps identify where fields originate
  Shows which fields are inherited or custom
  Filters can hide or show tables based on their relationship tree.
