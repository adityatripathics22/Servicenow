--> How ServiceNow Works (Core Concept)

ServiceNow runs in the cloud

  Users access apps and data on any device (computer, tablet, phone).
  All data is stored in a database.

Data is organized as:

  Tables → contain

    Records (e.g., User record, Task record)
    Fields (data about that record)

Everything in ServiceNow = a record in a table

  Every element (users, incidents, tasks, etc.) is a record.
  Tables support the applications running on the platform.


--> Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS)

The “green box” mentioned refers to the ServiceNow platform, an application platform as a service.

Some tables are:

  Shared by multiple applications

  App-specific, used only by certain modules
    Example:
      ITSM uses Incident table
      HR uses HR Case table


--> How Users Interact

Users send requests to the server, and the server performs actions such as:

    Creating records
    Updating records
    Viewing analytics
    Retrieving data

This is the foundation of how ServiceNow applications operate.

Topic: Roles, Access, and Impersonation 

--> Understanding Role-Based Access---

ServiceNow uses roles to control what users can see and do.

Examples from the table mentioned in the lecture:

  catalog role
    Gives access to the Service Catalog application and its related modules.

  user_criteria_admin role
    Access to only two modules:
      Service Catalog User Criteria
      Knowledge User Criteria

  catalog_admin role
    Access to all applications and modules that belong to:
      catalog role
      user_criteria_admin role
    Also includes additional catalog admin permissions.

--> Users Without Assigned Roles (Self-Service Users)

Even if a user has no roles, they can still:

  Log in to ServiceNow
  View dashboards
  Access the service catalog
  Read knowledge articles
  Take surveys

These users can access everything that doesn’t require a role, and are known as self-service users.

--> Impersonation in ServiceNow

As a System Administrator, you can:
  Impersonate other users to test visibility, permissions, and behavior.
  This helps ensure apps and modules work correctly for different roles.

Important Notes:
  Both Admins and users with the impersonator role can impersonate others.
  You cannot access features that you yourself don’t have permissions for.
    Example: You can’t access Security Incident features unless your own account has those roles.
  You cannot change passwords while impersonating.

--> What This Lab Covers

In this lab, you will explore:

  Granting access to users via roles
  Navigating the platform using different roles
  Impersonating users to understand their permissions and experience
