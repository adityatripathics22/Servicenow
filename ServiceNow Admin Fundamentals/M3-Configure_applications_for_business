2. Lists & Filters – Basics

Lists
  A list shows records from a table.
  Each row = a record
  Each column = a field
  Lists exist in core platform and workspace.

Filters
  Help you narrow down the list to only the records you need.
  All users can:
    Apply filters
    Create filters
    Modify filters
    Save filters



3. Views

Views allow the same list or form to be displayed differently for different users.

Examples of views:
  Employee
  Self-service
  Mobile
  Workspace
  Admin

To change view:
  Open list control menu
  Select View
  Choose a view (name appears in brackets unless it is default)



4. List Context Menus

Different menus give control over lists:

    1. List Context Menu
    Accessed by clicking the menu next to list title.
    Allows:
        Filtering
        Sorting
        Viewing the entire list

    2. Column Options Menu

    Open by clicking the three-dots icon on a columns
    Allows:
        Create reports
        Export data
        Sort, group, calculate

    3. List Fields Context Menu

    Right-click a cell:
        Tagging
        Filtering
        Field-level options


5. List Collector

  Lets you choose fields and their order while customizing lists.
  A plus (+) icon indicates a related table.


6. Dot-Walking

Dot-walking = accessing data in related tables using reference fields.

Used commonly in:
  Form builder
  Form layout
  List views
  Platform analytics
  Workflow Studio

Useful for showing information from other tables.


7. Adding Fields to a List

To add new fields:
  Use column menu → Configure List Layout
  Add fields in the Add New Field section
  Save to update list layout

Who can do this?
  Admins
  Users with personalize_list role

They can:
  Add/remove/rearrange columns


8. List Editing

Users can edit list data directly if allowed.

Important notes:
  Some fields cannot be edited
  Some tables have list editing disabled by default
  If a row cannot be edited → a message will show
  List Editor allows:
    Contiguous editing
    Non-contiguous editing
    Fast updates to multiple records


9. Personalize List Layout vs System List Layout
  Personalize List Layout
    Affects only the current user
    Used for temporary change
    Does not affect global settings

  You can:
    Add columns
    Remove columns
    Rearrange columns
    Reset to default view

  If an admin updates the system view, personalized views won’t show new default columns unless reset.

  System List Layout
    Visible to everyone
    Used for permanent changes
    Admin-configured


10. Tags

Users can:
  Add personal tags
  View tagged records

  View modules under the application
  Add new modules if needed


13. Lists in Workspaces

Lists help:

Useful for organizing data without heavy configuration.

1. What Are Forms in ServiceNow?

Forms display a single record from a table.
Each record contains fields, and forms show those fields in a structured layout.

Why forms matter:
  Users view or edit important data
  Each user may need different data depending on their role

  Example:
    Major Incident Manager → sees Major Incident tab
    HR Payroll Specialist → sees salary data not visible to others


2. How ServiceNow Organizes Data

  Uses a database structure
  Tables store data (e.g., User, Incident, HR Case)
  Records = each row
  Fields = data inside the record (e.g., Department, Email)
  Depending on roles, users see different information
