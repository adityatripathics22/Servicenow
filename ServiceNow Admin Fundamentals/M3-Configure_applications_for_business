2. Lists & Filters – Basics

Lists
  A list shows records from a table.
  Each row = a record
  Each column = a field
  Lists exist in core platform and workspace.

Filters
  Help you narrow down the list to only the records you need.
  All users can:
    Apply filters
    Create filters
    Modify filters
    Save filters



3. Views

Views allow the same list or form to be displayed differently for different users.

Examples of views:
  Employee
  Self-service
  Mobile
  Workspace
  Admin

To change view:
  Open list control menu
  Select View
  Choose a view (name appears in brackets unless it is default)




4. List Context Menus

Different menus give control over lists:

    1. List Context Menu
    Accessed by clicking the menu next to list title.
    Allows:
        Filtering
        Sorting
        Viewing the entire list

    2. Column Options Menu

    Open by clicking the three-dots icon on a columns
    Allows:
        Create reports
        Export data
        Sort, group, calculate

    3. List Fields Context Menu

    Right-click a cell:
        Tagging
        Filtering
        Field-level options



5. List Collector

  Lets you choose fields and their order while customizing lists.
  A plus (+) icon indicates a related table.



6. Dot-Walking

Dot-walking = accessing data in related tables using reference fields.

Used commonly in:
  Form builder
  Form layout
  List views
  Platform analytics
  Workflow Studio

Useful for showing information from other tables.



7. Adding Fields to a List

To add new fields:
  Use column menu → Configure List Layout
  Add fields in the Add New Field section
  Save to update list layout

Who can do this?
  Admins
  Users with personalize_list role

They can:
  Add/remove/rearrange columns



8. List Editing

Users can edit list data directly if allowed.

Important notes:
  Some fields cannot be edited
  Some tables have list editing disabled by default
  If a row cannot be edited → a message will show
  List Editor allows:
    Contiguous editing
    Non-contiguous editing
    Fast updates to multiple records



9. Personalize List Layout vs System List Layout
  Personalize List Layout
    Affects only the current user
    Used for temporary change
    Does not affect global settings

  You can:
    Add columns
    Remove columns
    Rearrange columns
    Reset to default view

  If an admin updates the system view, personalized views won’t show new default columns unless reset.

  System List Layout
    Visible to everyone
    Used for permanent changes
    Admin-configured



10. Tags

Users can:
  Add personal tags
  View tagged records
  Workspace: filled tag icon = tags assigned



11. Adding Lists to Application Menu

You can add your custom list to the application menu:
  Helps users quickly find the lists they use
  Use filter navigator to find application menus



12. Locating Application on the List

Example: “Self-Service”
  Select the title to open record
  View modules under the application
  Add new modules if needed



13. Lists in Workspaces

Lists help:
  Filter records
  Show issues like incidents, cases
  Group records

Admins use lists to track tasks and manage workflows.



14. Creating List Categories

To create list categories:
  Apply filters
  Save them
  Make categories appear in explorer/workspace

Useful for organizing data without heavy configuration.



15. Column Actions

Using icons, you can:
  Drag-and-drop columns
  Group rows by column value
  Filter data
  Quickly sort
  Change column width

Topic: Form Configuration, Fields, Form Builder, Templates, Dot-Walking



1. What Are Forms in ServiceNow?

Forms display a single record from a table.
Each record contains fields, and forms show those fields in a structured layout.

Why forms matter:
  Users view or edit important data
  Each user may need different data depending on their role

  Example:
    Major Incident Manager → sees Major Incident tab
    HR Payroll Specialist → sees salary data not visible to others



2. How ServiceNow Organizes Data

  Uses a database structure
  Tables store data (e.g., User, Incident, HR Case)
  Records = each row
  Fields = data inside the record (e.g., Department, Email)
  Depending on roles, users see different information



3. Form Elements

Forms include:
  Fields
  Sections
  Formatters
  Related Lists
  UI Actions
  Activity Stream
  Tabs

These help users navigate and interact with records efficiently.



4. Field Types

ServiceNow supports 30+ field types, for example:
  Reference
  Date & Time
  String
  Choice
  True/False

When creating a new record:
  Make sure you’re using the correct view
  Some fields must be filled before saving
  Changing views may require saving/discarding changes



5. Ways to Modify a Form

Three main tools:

1. Form Builder
2. Form Design
3. Form Layout

⚠ Avoid adding the same editable field in multiple form sections
This can break UI Policies or Data Policies.



6. Form Builder (Main Tool for Admins)
  Form Builder allows you to:
    Add fields
    Move fields
    Delete fields
    Add related lists
    Select layouts
    Apply rules

  Admins can also configure:
    UI Policies
    Access Control Rules
    Client Scripts
    Business Rules
    Workspace View Rules

You can configure field attributes through the Configuration Panel.



7. Dot-Walking on Forms

Dot-walking lets you display data from a related table.

Steps:
  Click Add Related Field
  Select field from reference table
  Add to form
  Save → field appears on form



8. Adding New Fields to Tables

Steps:
  Go to System Definition → Tables
  Select table
  Add new field under Columns tab
  Return to form and place field using Form Builder
  


9. Formatters

Examples of built-in formatters:
  Activity formatter
  Parent breadcrumbs
  Approval summarizer
  CI Relations
  Process flow formatter
T hese add functionality to the form.



10. Related Lists on Forms

Using the List Collector, you can:
  Add related lists
  Remove related lists
  Reorder related lists
  Ensure the correct form view is selected.



11. Personalizing a Form (User-Specific)

To personalize:
  Open a record
  Click Personalize Form icon
  Hide/show fields (only non-mandatory fields)
  Reset hidden fields if needed

Personalized layout persists for that user only.

 

12. Form Templates

Templates help users fill common fields automatically.

Features:
  Show a check mark if updated

  Can be created for:
    Incident
    Change
    HR Case
    Any table

  No limit to number of templates

  But too many templates become difficult to manage

⚠ Only certain groups should create templates
→ to avoid bypassing mandatory fields, UI policies, workflows

Admins can:

  Set scripts to automatically apply templates
  Make templates available to groups/users



13. Templates in Workspace

Workspace forms use a different layout:
  Form is in Details tab
  Fields in Details Panel
  Activity Stream in a separate panel

To share a workspace template
  Use magnifying glass
  Choose groups
  Save template

⚠ Deleted templates cannot be recovered.



14. Creating a Custom Form Template

Steps:
  Go to Templates Pane
  Click Plus (+)
  Name the template
  Add/remove fields
  Save

In your lab, you only need to add a new field to a form.

Topic: Advanced Configuration – Choice Lists & Reference Fields


1. Why Advanced Configuration Matters

As an administrator, you must configure:
  Choice fields
  Reference fields

These fields help teams maintain accurate, high-quality data when recording issues or incidents.


2. Choice Lists vs Reference Lists
Choice Lists
  Marked by a dropdown arrow
  Options are stored on the same table (e.g., Incident categories)

Reference Lists
  Marked by a magnifying glass
  Options come from a different table
    Examples:
      Service table
      Configuration Item (CI) table
      Service Offering table

Reference fields are more powerful because they allow relationships between tables.
