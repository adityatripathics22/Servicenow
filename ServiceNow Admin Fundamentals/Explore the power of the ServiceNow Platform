In this module, you will learn:

How to brand and tailor your ServiceNow instance to match your company.
The difference between configuration (recommended) and customization (should be used carefully).
How different users (marketing, developers, admins) work with instance settings.


2. What Is an Instance?

A ServiceNow instance:

  Is hosted in a ServiceNow data center (cloud) or sometimes on-site.
  Has a unique URL.
  Uses a multi-instance, single-tenant architecture, meaning:
    Every customer gets a separate database.
    Your data is isolated from other customers.

  Types of Instances

  Customers always receive two instances:
    Production – live environment.
    Non-production – used for development/testing.

  Additional instances may be added for:
    QA
    Testing
    Development


3. Making Changes Using Update Sets

  Changes to an instance are collected and moved using Update Sets.
  Update Sets allow you to package changes and migrate them to production.
  More details on update sets will come later in a separate module.

Important Note

Some tables or features may require extra licensing if they extend the CMDB.
Always confirm with the ServiceNow account executive before adding such tables.


4. Customization & Configuration Options

ServiceNow allows you to configure or customize things like:

  Company branding
  Instance logo
  Browser tab label
  System properties
  Application installation
  Plugins


5. Branding & Navigation Settings

You can personalize the instance through:
  System Properties → My Company
    Set banner image
    Set instance logo

  Browser tab text
    Helps you differentiate between multiple instances during work.


6. Licensing Requirements

  Make sure your ServiceNow instance has the required valid licenses.
  Applications must be licensed before use.
  Apps can be installed or removed from the ServiceNow Store.


7. Plugins

  Plugins enhance ServiceNow’s features.
  Plugins are stored as records in tables.
  You can search for plugins by name or ID.
  If a plugin is not available, you can request ServiceNow to activate it.


8. Application Scoping

Scoping controls:
  Which files/data an app can access.
  Prevents apps from interacting with each other unless permissions are explicitly granted.

Example:
  A room booking app cannot access HR data unless permission is provided.
  For learning scoped application development → Application Development Fundamentals is recommended.
