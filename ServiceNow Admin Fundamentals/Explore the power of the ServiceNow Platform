In this module, you will learn:

How to brand and tailor your ServiceNow instance to match your company.
The difference between configuration (recommended) and customization (should be used carefully).
How different users (marketing, developers, admins) work with instance settings.


2. What Is an Instance?

A ServiceNow instance:

  Is hosted in a ServiceNow data center (cloud) or sometimes on-site.
  Has a unique URL.
  Uses a multi-instance, single-tenant architecture, meaning:
    Every customer gets a separate database.
    Your data is isolated from other customers.

  Types of Instances

  Customers always receive two instances:
    Production – live environment.
    Non-production – used for development/testing.

  Additional instances may be added for:
    QA
    Testing
    Development


3. Making Changes Using Update Sets

  Changes to an instance are collected and moved using Update Sets.
  Update Sets allow you to package changes and migrate them to production.
  More details on update sets will come later in a separate module.

Important Note

Some tables or features may require extra licensing if they extend the CMDB.
Always confirm with the ServiceNow account executive before adding such tables.


4. Customization & Configuration Options

ServiceNow allows you to configure or customize things like:

  Company branding
  Instance logo
  Browser tab label
  System properties
  Application installation
  Plugins
